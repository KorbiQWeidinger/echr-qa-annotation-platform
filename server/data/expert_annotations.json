    "question": "How does the Court apply Article 17 of the Convention to cases involving denial of the Holocaust and what factors does the Court consider in determining the manifestly ill-founded nature of the applicants' complaints under Article 10?",
    "answer": "In a case concerning Holocaust denial, whether the Court applies Article 17 directly, declaring a complaint incompatible ratione materiae, or instead finds Article 10 applicable, invoking Article 17 at a later stage when it examines the necessity of the alleged interference, is a decision taken on a case- by-case basis and will depend on all the circumstances of each individual case (Past\u00f6rs v. Germany, 2019, \u00a7 37). In those cases it was faced with statements, almost invariably emanating from persons professing Nazi-like views or linked with Nazi-inspired movements, that cast doubt on the reality of the persecution and extermination of millions of Jews under the Nazi regime; claimed that the Holocaust was a lie, contrived as a means of political extortion; denied the existence of the concentration camps or justified it; or claimed either that the gas chambers in those camps had never existed or that the number of persons killed in them was highly exaggerated and technically impossible. The Commission, frequently referring to the historical experience of the States concerned, described such statements as attacks on the Jewish community, which ran counter to justice and peace and further reflected racial and religious discrimination. After recalling its Article 17 case-law, the Court rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 as manifestly ill-founded. The applicant could not have been unaware that his statements were capable of casting doubt as to the extent of the extermination of the Jews during the Second World War, especially in the context of a debate raging at the university due to negationist and racist views defended by some of its teaching staff. His possible contribution to the negationist discourse and the resulting disorder within the university had been incompatible with his duties and responsibilities as a teacher. The Court attached fundamental importance to the fact that the applicant had planned his speech in advance, deliberately resorting to obfuscation to get his message across. Article 17 had thus an important role to play, as the applicant had sought to use his right to freedom of expression with the aim of promoting ideas contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention and that weighed heavily in the assessment of the necessity of the interference. The applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 was eventually rejected as manifestly ill-founded.",

          "37": ". The Court reiterates that Article 17 is only applicable on an exceptional basis and in extreme cases and should, in cases concerning Article 10 of the Convention, only be resorted to if it is immediately clear that the impugned statements sought to deflect this Article from its real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for ends clearly contrary to the values of the Convention (see Perin\u00e7ek , cited above, \u00a7 114). The decisive point when assessing whether statements, verbal or non-verbal, are removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17, is whether those statements are directed against the Convention\u2019s underlying values, for example by stirring up hatred or violence, or whether by making the statement, the author attempted to rely on the Convention to engage in an activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in it (see ibid., \u00a7 115; and Roj TV A/S , cited above, \u00a7 31). In a case concerning Holocaust denial, whether the Court applies Article 17 directly, declaring a complaint incompatible ratione materiae , or instead finds Article 10 applicable, invoking Article 17 at a later stage when it examines the necessity of the alleged interference, is a decision taken on a case-by-case basis and will depend on all the circumstances of each individual case."

    "question": "Based on the severity test and the criteria for applying Article 8, how does the Court differentiate between acts or measures that give rise to an interference with the right to respect for private life and those that do not?",
    "answer": "The Court declared the application inadmissible ratione materiae. The Court also applied the above-mentioned severity test in cases involving identity checks, allegedly based on physical or ethnic motives. That threshold is only attained if the person concerned has an arguable claim that he or she may have been targeted on account of specific physical or ethnic characteristics. In this connection, the Court observed that the public nature of the check might have an effect on a person\u2019s reputation and self-respect (Basu v. Germany, 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 25-27; Muhammad v. Spain, 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 49-51). Not every act or measure which may be said to affect adversely the moral integrity of a person necessarily gives rise to such an interference. However, once a measure is found to have seriously affected the applicant\u2019s private life, the complaint will be compatible ratione materiae with the Convention and an issue of the \u201cright to respect for private life\u201d will arise. In this regard, the question of applicability and the existence of interference with the right to respect for private life are often inextricably linked (Vu\u010dina v. Croatia (dec.), 2019, \u00a7 32).",

Having regard to these principles, the Court considers that not every identity check of a person belonging to an ethnic minority attains the necessary threshold of severity so as to fall within the ambit of the right to respect for that person\u2019s private life. That threshold is only attained if the person concerned has an arguable claim that he or she may have been targeted on account of specific physical or ethnic characteristics. Such an arguable claim may notably exist where the person concerned submitted that he or she (or persons having the same characteristics) had been the only person(s) subjected to a check and where no other grounds for the check were apparent or where any explanations of the officers carrying out the check disclose specific physical or ethnic motives for the check. The Court further observes in this regard that the public nature of the check may have an effect on a person\u2019s reputation (see paragraph 23 above) and self-respect.",
          "26": ". The Court notes that the applicant had been subjected to an identity check by the police in public, on a train. In the applicant\u2019s submission, that check had only been carried out because of his dark skin colour and thus on racial grounds. He substantiated that allegation by his observation that of the persons present in different compartments of the train carriage, he and his daughter had been the only persons with a dark skin colour and the only persons who had been subjected to the check. Furthermore, the explanations given by the police officer who had carried out the check had not disclosed any other objective grounds for targeting the applicant. The Court therefore cannot agree with the Government\u2019s argument that in these circumstances, there was no arguable claim that the applicant had been targeted on account of specific physical or ethnic characteristics. The applicant further argued that the identity check under these conditions had had serious negative effects on his private life as he had felt so stigmatised and humiliated that he had stopped travelling by train for several months.",
          "27": ". The Court considers that the applicant substantiated his argument that the identity check by the police under these special circumstances had had sufficiently serious consequences for his right to respect for his private life.

The Court also notes that an identity check by the police can fall within the scope of the private life of the person subjected to that check, and therefore, constitute an interference in that person\u2019s private life as protected by Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, the Court has found that the use of coercive powers conferred by legislation to require an individual to submit to an identity check and a detailed search of his person, his clothing and his personal belongings amounted to an interference with the right to respect for private life (see Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom , no. 4158/05, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2010 (extracts), and Vig v. Hungary , no. 59648/13, \u00a7 49, 14 January 2021).

According to his submission, that check had only been carried out because of his dark skin colour and thus on racial grounds. The identity check necessarily affected the applicant\u2019s private life, and would have been sufficient to affect his psychological integrity and ethnic identity, for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention (see Kir\u00e1ly and D\u00f6m\u00f6t\u00f6r v.

In certain contexts, the Court has considered it necessary to specifically examine whether the effects of the act in question attained a threshold of severity \u2013 that is, had serious negative effects on the individual\u2019s private life \u2013 in order for Article 8 to be applicable (see, in particular, Denisov v. Ukraine, no. 76639/11, \u00a7\u00a7 110-13, 25 September 2018). It has ruled, for instance, that an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and be carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life in order for Article 8 to come into play (see, inter alia , B\u00e9dat v.

In Denisov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112-14), the Grand Chamber held that in such cases the effects of the statement or act must rise above a certain \u201cthreshold of severity\u201d. Although the specific issue in Denisov was whether a dismissal from one\u2019s professional position could engage Article 8, the broader point made there has subsequently been applied in cases raising very different issues.

In Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania (no. 41288/15, \u00a7 117, 14 January 2020), which concerned a matter much closer to the one under examination here, the Court found that violently homophobic statements made under a photograph published on the applicants\u2019 Facebook page had attained a sufficient level of seriousness to affect their \u201cprivate life\u201d, and that Article 8 was thus engaged in respect of those statements. The Court emphasised in that connection that for Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for one\u2019s private life (ibid., \u00a7 109).

It appears, however, necessary to spell out more explicitly the kinds of considerations which may have a bearing on the assessment of that question. They can be inferred from the Court\u2019s findings in those cases, albeit not expressly articulated therein. Some guidance can also be derived from the Court\u2019s general approach to the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention in cases in which the assertion is that a person\u2019s \u201cprivate life\u201d has been negatively affected by a statement or an act. In Denisov (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 112-14), the Grand Chamber held that in such cases the effects of the statement or act must rise above a certain \u201cthreshold of severity\u201d. Although the specific issue in Denisov was whether a dismissal from one\u2019s professional position could engage Article 8, the broader point made there has subsequently been applied in cases raising very different issues. For instance, in Hudorovi\u010d and Others v. Slovenia (nos. 24816/14 and 25140/14, \u00a7\u00a7 115 and 157, 10 March 2020), which concerned access to safe drinking water and sanitation by members of the Roma minority, the Court expressly referred to Denisov (\u00a7 114) and then relied on it to emphasise that the State\u2019s alleged failure to provide the applicants with access to safe drinking water would only raise an issue under Article 8 if there was convincing evidence that this failure had effectively eroded their core rights under that provision. In Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania (no. 41288/15, \u00a7 117, 14 January 2020), which concerned a matter much closer to the one under examination here, the Court found that violently homophobic statements made under a photograph published on the applicants\u2019 Facebook page had attained a sufficient level of seriousness to affect their \u201cprivate life\u201d, and that Article 8 was thus engaged in respect of those statements. The Court emphasised in that connection that for Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person must attain a certain level of seriousness and be made in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for one\u2019s private life (ibid., \u00a7 109). In contrast, in Vu\u010dina v.

    "question": "In a case where a Contracting State exercises effective control over an area outside its national territory, what are the criteria under Article 1 of the Convention that establish the State's responsibility to secure the rights set out in the Convention within that area?",
    "answer": "The fact that the local administration survives as a result of the Contracting State\u2019s military and other support entails that State\u2019s responsibility for its policies and actions. The controlling State has the responsibility under Article 1 to secure, within the area under its control, the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which it has ratified. It will be liable for any violations of those rights exactly in the same way as if those violations had occurred strictly speaking on its own territory (Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], 2001, \u00a7\u00a7 76-77; Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, \u00a7 138; Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], 2012, \u00a7 106; Ukraine and the Netherlands v. Russia [GC] (dec.), 2022, \u00a7 561). Furthermore, where a Contracting State exercises overall control over an area outside its national territory, its responsibility is not confined to the acts of its soldiers or officials in that area but also extends to acts of the local administration which survives there by virtue of its military and other support (Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], 2001, \u00a7 77; Ila\u015fcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], 2004, \u00a7 316). In such a case, where there is effective control over an area, the State will have jurisdiction ratione loci (Ukraine and the Netherlands v. Russia [GC] (dec.), 2022, \u00a7 561). The question whether a Contracting State is genuinely exercising effective control over a territory outside its borders is one of fact. In seeking to answer that question the Court primarily has regard to the following two criteria: \u25aa the number of soldiers deployed by the State in the territory in question; this is the criterion to which the Court had hitherto attached the greatest importance (Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 56; Ila\u015fcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], 2004, \u00a7 387); \u25aa the extent to which the State\u2019s military, economic and political support for the local subordinate administration provides it with influence and control over the region (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 388-394; Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, \u00a7 139).",

However, it is to be observed that the Court's reasoning is framed in terms of a broad statement of principle as regards Turkey's general responsibility under the Convention for the policies and actions of the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities. Having effective overall control over northern Cyprus, its responsibility cannot be confined to the acts of its own soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but must also be engaged by virtue of the acts of the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support. It follows that, in terms of Article 1 of the Convention, Turkey's \u201cjurisdiction\u201d must be considered to extend to securing the entire range of substantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which she has ratified, and that violations of those rights are imputable to Turkey."

Firstly, the acts of diplomatic and consular agents, who are present on foreign territory in accordance with provisions of international law, may amount to an exercise of jurisdiction when these agents exert authority and control over others. Secondly, the Court has recognised the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by a Contracting State when, through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory, it exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that government. Where, in accordance with custom, treaty or other agreement, authorities of the Contracting State perform executive or judicial duties on the territory of another State, the Contracting State may be responsible for any breaches of the Convention thereby incurred, as long as the acts in question are attributable to it rather than to the territorial State. In addition, in certain circumstances, the use of force by a State\u2019s agents operating outside its territory may bring the individual thereby brought under the control of the State\u2019s authorities into the State\u2019s Article 1 jurisdiction. It is clear that whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority over an individual, and thus jurisdiction, the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that are relevant to his or her situation.

It was for Contracting States to decide the extent to which all or some of the Convention rights were extended to overseas territories for whose international relations they were responsible. The concept of \u201cState agent authority or control\u201d and \u201ceffective control over an area\u201d were not intended by the Court to supplant the declaratory system put in place by Article 56. The fact that the Contracting State was responsible for the international relations of an overseas territory and therefore might exercise a degree of control over certain of its governmental functions did not mean that all overseas territories fell within the jurisdiction of that Contracting State for the purposes of Article 1. Otherwise, the Convention would effectively be applicable to all overseas territories of a Contracting State regardless of the local requirements of the territory in question. Such construction would supplant and replace the system of declarations established under Article 56. The Court in Al-Skeini expressly stated that it was not doing so."

Firstly, the acts of diplomatic and consular agents, who are present on foreign territory in accordance with provisions of international law, may amount to an exercise of jurisdiction when these agents exert authority and control over others. Secondly, the Court has recognised the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction by a Contracting State when, through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory, it exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by that government. Where, in accordance with custom, treaty or other agreement, authorities of the Contracting State perform executive or judicial duties on the territory of another State, the Contracting State may be responsible for any breaches of the Convention thereby incurred, as long as the acts in question are attributable to it rather than to the territorial State. In addition, in certain circumstances, the use of force by a State\u2019s agents operating outside its territory may bring the individual thereby brought under the control of the State\u2019s authorities into the State\u2019s Article 1 jurisdiction. It is clear that whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority over an individual, and thus jurisdiction, the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that are relevant to his or her situation. In this sense, therefore, the Convention rights can be \u201cdivided and tailored\u201d (see Al-Skeini and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 133-37, and the cases cited therein, and Georgia v.

    "question": "How does the Court determine whether a restriction on the right to vote and the right to stand for election, as guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, is compatible with the principle of the rule of law and the general objectives of the Convention, considering the political evolution of the country concerned and the criteria of arbitrariness, lack of proportionality, and interference with the free expression of the opinion of the people?",
    "answer": "There is room for \u201cimplied limitations\u201d, and the Contracting States must be given a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere. The concept of \u201cimplied limitations\u201d under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is of major importance for the determination of the relevance of the aims pursued by the restrictions on the rights guaranteed by this provision. In examining compliance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court has focused mainly on two criteria: whether there has been arbitrariness or a lack of proportionality, and whether the restriction has interfered with the free expression of the opinion of the people. In addition, it underlines the need to assess any electoral legislation in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, which means that unacceptable features in one system may be justified in another (Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 1987, \u00a7 52; \u017ddanoka v. Latvia [GC], 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 103-104 and 115). The Court has held that post-election phases must be surrounded by precise procedural safeguards; the process must be transparent and open, and observers from all parties must be allowed to participate, including opposition representatives. It pointed out, however, that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 was not conceived as a code on electoral matters designed to regulate all aspects of the electoral process. Thus the Court\u2019s level of scrutiny in a given case depended on the aspect of the right to free elections. Tighter scrutiny should be reserved for any departures from the principle of universal suffrage, but a broader margin of appreciation could be afforded to States where the measures prevented candidates from standing for elections.",

III, p. 264, and vol. IV, p. 24). They have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Protocol No. 1 (P1) have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see, amongst other authorities and mutatis mutandis, the Lithgow and Others judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, p. 71, \u00a7 194). In particular, such conditions must not thwart \"the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\"."

Nonetheless, these rights are not absolute. There is room for \u201cimplied limitations\u201d, and Contracting States must be given a margin of appreciation in this sphere.

There are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe, which it is for each Contracting State to mould into its own democratic vision (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no.\u00a02) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005-IX).",

In particular, any such conditions must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature \u2013 in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hirst, cited above, \u00a7 62).",

    "answer": "Given the variety of means available to achieve restitutio in integrum and the nature of the issues involved, in the exercise of its competence under Article 46 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the Committee of Ministers is considered to be better placed than the Court to assess the specific measures to be taken. It is thus for the Committee of Ministers to supervise, on the basis of the information provided by the respondent State and with due regard to the applicant\u2019s evolving situation, the adoption of such measures that are feasible, timely, adequate and sufficient to ensure the maximum possible reparation for the violations found by the Court (Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan [GC], 2019, \u00a7 155).3 The Committee is the executive body of the Council of Europe and as such its work has a political character. That said, when supervising the execution of judgments it is fulfilling a particular task which consists of applying the relevant legal rules. The execution process concerns compliance by a Contracting Party with its obligations in international law under Article 46 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Those obligations are based on the principles of international law relating to cessation, non-repetition and reparation as reflected in the ARSIWA. Accordingly, the supervision mechanism under Article 46 of the Convention provides a comprehensive framework for the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments, reinforced by the Committee of Ministers\u2019 practice. Within that framework, the Committee\u2019s continuous supervision work has generated a corpus of public documents encompassing information submitted by respondent States and others concerned by the execution process, and recording decisions taken by the Committee in cases pending before it. That practice has also influenced general standard-setting in the Committee\u2019s Recommendations to the Member States on topics relevant to execution issues (for example Recommendation R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights4, or Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)3 on effective remedies for excessive length of proceedings5).",

    "question": "How does the margin of appreciation apply to the State's discretion in cases concerning the recognition of filiation between children and persons with whom they have no biological link, particularly when the child-parent bond is touched?",
    "answer": "The margin of appreciation is wide in cases concerning the recognition in law of filiation between children and persons with whom they have no biological link. However, the margin may be reduced when the child-parent bond is touched. This is particularly the case of the bond of filiation, which unites a person to his parent, especially when this person is a minor. Moreover, even when the State is within its margin, its decisions are not beyond the control of the Court, which will undertake a careful examination of the arguments to ensure that an appropriate balance has been struck with regard to the child\u2019s interests (C.E. and Others v. France, 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 85-90). Article 8 requires that the domestic authorities strike a fair balance between the interests of the child and those of the parents and that, in the balancing process, particular importance should be attached to the best interests of the child, which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents (see the recapitulation of the general principles in Abdi Ibrahim v. Norway [GC], 2021, \u00a7 145).",

Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will be narrow. Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider. It will in general be wider where the State is required to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or Convention rights (see, in particular, A.P., Gar\u00e7on and Nicot v. France , nos. 79885/12 and 2 others, \u00a7 121, 6 April 2017; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen , cited above, \u00a7 67, and the authorities cited therein; and the Advisory opinion concerning the recognition in domestic law of a legal parent-child relationship between a child born through a gestational surrogacy arrangement abroad and the intended mother [GC], request no.

The Court observes that the present applications, which concern the recognition of a legal parent-child relationship between children and individuals to whom they are not biologically related, raise a number of ethical issues. It further notes that the applicants did not dispute the Government\u2019s statement to the effect that there was no European consensus on the establishment of a legal parent-child relationship between a child and his or her biological mother\u2019s former female partner .",

This is especially the case with regard to the legal relationship between an individual and his or her parent, particularly where the individual is a minor.",
          "89": ". The respondent State therefore had a narrower margin of appreciation when it came to examining the situation of the children, M.B. and T.G. (compare Mennesson , cited above, \u00a7 80; see also the Advisory opinion , cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45).",
          "90": ". Moreover, the choices made by the State \u2013 even within the limits of this margin \u2013 are not beyond the scrutiny of the Court, to which it falls to examine carefully the arguments taken into consideration and leading to the solution reached and to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests at stake. In doing so, it must have regard to the essential principle according to which, whenever the situation of a child is in issue, the best interests of that child are paramount (see, for example, Mennesson , cited above, \u00a7 81).

Even so, that was not sufficient to limit the applicant\u2019s parental rights towards the child. On this point the District Court relied on the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that in such cases the child\u2019s best interests were of paramount concern. This had two aspects: on the one hand, it was necessary to ensure that the child grew in a safe environment, and that in no circumstances could a mother have recourse to measures which could harm the child\u2019s health and development (the court relied on Johansen v. Norway, 7\u00a0August 1996, \u00a7\u00a078, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). On the other hand, it was also obvious that the best interests of the child were to grow with his family, unless it was proven that the family was inappropriate, because to do otherwise would mean separating the child from his roots. Moreover, even though the national authorities had wide discretion when deciding whether to give the child to his or her biological parents, the family connection could be restricted only in \u201cparticularly special circumstances\u201d and everything had to be done in order to safeguard the personal connection and, if and when possible, \u201crestore the family\u201d (the court cited Amanalachioai v.

According to them, this was a presumption applicable to relationships based on biological ties, to prevent conflicts arising from the recognition of dual relationships of the same nature, which only made sense within the framework of kinship by blood. The Government referred to the opinion delivered by the Court of Cassation on 7 March 2018 to the effect that the lower court could not deliver a document attesting to a matter of common knowledge establishing de facto enjoyment of status in favour of the same-sex partner of a parent with whom a legal parent-child relationship had already been established (see paragraph 18 above), and pointed out that the creation of dual relationships with parents of the same sex was only possible through adoption."

The Government furthermore explained that the mechanism of de facto enjoyment of status did not permit recognition of a legal parent-child relationship in circumstances such as those in the present case. They clarified that this mechanism was used extremely rarely as a means of establishing parent-child relationships (currently fewer than ten cases per year) and was mainly used to obtain recognition of one\u2019s status as an heir with regard to one\u2019s father when he had not legally recognised his children, and in the case of children born out of wedlock whose father had died before they were born, without having legally recognised them. They argued that de facto enjoyment of status, which appeared under Book 1, Title VII of the Civil Code, entitled \u201clegal parent-child relationships\u201d, had been designed and developed with reference to blood ties or, at the very least, on the basis of the heterosexual reality of parent-child relationships. They submitted that it was thus designed, in principle, for the legal recognition of a pre-existing parent-child relationship and not to establish a relationship the sole basis for which was the claimants\u2019 wishes. According to them, this was a presumption applicable to relationships based on biological ties, to prevent conflicts arising from the recognition of dual relationships of the same nature, which only made sense within the framework of kinship by blood. The Government referred to the opinion delivered by the Court of Cassation on 7 March 2018 to the effect that the lower court could not deliver a document attesting to a matter of common knowledge establishing de facto enjoyment of status in favour of the same-sex partner of a parent with whom a legal parent-child relationship had already been established (see paragraph 18 above), and pointed out that the creation of dual relationships with parents of the same sex was only possible through adoption."

LITHUANIA; \u00a7 41: The court acknowledged N.V.\u2019s arguments that a close connection had been established between her and the applicant\u2019s daughter, and that she loved the child and had the complete ability to take care of her. Even so, that was not sufficient to limit the applicant\u2019s parental rights towards the child. On this point the District Court relied on the Court\u2019s case-law to the effect that in such cases the child\u2019s best interests were of paramount concern. This had two aspects: on the one hand, it was necessary to ensure that the child grew in a safe environment, and that in no circumstances could a mother have recourse to measures which could harm the child\u2019s health and development (the court relied on Johansen v. Norway, 7\u00a0August 1996, \u00a7\u00a078, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III). On the other hand, it was also obvious that the best interests of the child were to grow with his family, unless it was proven that the family was inappropriate, because to do otherwise would mean separating the child from his roots. Moreover, even though the national authorities had wide discretion when deciding whether to give the child to his or her biological parents, the family connection could be restricted only in \u201cparticularly special circumstances\u201d and everything had to be done in order to safeguard the personal connection and, if and when possible, \u201crestore the family\u201d (the court cited Amanalachioai v.

RUSSIA; \u00a7 42: In this connection, the Court reiterates that the right to protection of one\u2019s reputation is covered by Article 8 of the Convention as part of the right to respect for private life (see Chauvy and Others v. France, no.\u00a064915/01, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2004-VI; Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7 35, 15\u00a0November 2007; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no.\u00a034147/06, \u00a7 40, 21 September 2010; and, more recently, Annen v.\u00a0Germany, no. 3690/10, \u00a7 54, 26 November 2015). For Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life\u201d (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany, no.\u00a039954/08, \u00a7 83, 7\u00a0February 2012). The Court further reiterates that, for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in defamation is a requisite element. Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person in question was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant, or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Reznik v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4977/05, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2013, and the authorities cited therein)."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 42: In this connection, the Court reiterates that the right to protection of one\u2019s reputation is covered by Article 8 of the Convention as part of the right to respect for private life (see Chauvy and Others v. France, no.\u00a064915/01, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2004-VI; Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7 35, 15\u00a0November 2007; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no.\u00a034147/06, \u00a7 40, 21 September 2010; and, more recently, Annen v.\u00a0Germany, no. 3690/10, \u00a7 54, 26 November 2015). For Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life\u201d (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany, no.\u00a039954/08, \u00a7 83, 7\u00a0February 2012). The Court further reiterates that, for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in defamation is a requisite element. Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person in question was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant, or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Reznik v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4977/05, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2013, and the authorities cited therein)."

    "question": "Under what circumstances can a person be presumed dead based on the passage of time since their detention, and is a finding of state involvement necessary for this presumption to be made?",
    "answer": "Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, 2000, \u00a7 82). It must be accepted that the more time goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. However, this presumption of death is not automatic and is only reached on examination of the circumstances of the case, in which the lapse of time since the person was seen alive or heard from is a relevant element (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, \u00a7 143; Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, 2012, \u00a7 100). Moreover, a finding of State involvement in the disappearance of a person is not a condition sine qua non for the purposes of establishing whether that person can be presumed dead; in certain circumstances the disappearance of a person may in itself be considered as life-threatening (Medova v. Russia, 2009, \u00a7 90). Once the Court considers that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the disappeared person must be presumed dead following his or her unacknowledged detention by State agents, the responsibility of the State is engaged.",

    "question": "How does the Court define the criteria for applying rights under the Convention, and why is it important to ensure the applicability of the Convention throughout the entire territory of a State, without selective restrictions?",
    "answer": "Whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority, and thus jurisdiction, over an individual, the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that are relevant to the situation of that individual. The Convention precludes territorial exclusions other than in the instance referred to in Article 56 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (dependent territories) (ibid., \u00a7 140; N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], 2020, \u00a7 106; and A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2022, \u00a7 61). In other words, the territorial scope of the Convention cannot be reduced, selectively and artificially, to only certain parts of the territory of a Contracting State (ibid., 2022, \u00a7 63). Indeed, for reasons of legal policy \u2013 the need to maintain equality between the States Parties and to ensure the effectiveness of the Convention \u2013 it could not be otherwise. But for the presumption, the applicability of the Convention could be selectively restricted to only parts of the territory of certain States Parties, thus rendering the notion of effective human rights protection underpinning the entire Convention meaningless while, at the same time, allowing discrimination between the States Parties, that is to say between those which accepted the application of the Convention over the whole of their territory and those which did not (Assanidze v. Georgia, 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 141-142). Moreover, the practical difficulties in the migration context cannot justify leaving an area outside the law where individuals are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure (A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2022, \u00a7 63). The Convention is a constitutional instrument of European public order.",

There were previously seven Ukrainian-language schools in Crimea, and 500 schools in which at least some classes were available in the Ukrainian language. There were also numerous public schools in which it was possible for Tatar students to study in their own language. During 2014, however, this educational plurality was heavily suppressed (though no details as to those specifically responsible were provided), depriving ethnic Ukrainians and Tatars of the possibility of receiving education in their native tongue. As stated in paragraph 238 of the Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of 15 November 2014, by the end of the year there were only twenty secondary schools in which it was possible to receive any form of education in Ukrainian (see paragraph 238 of the Report mentioned in paragraph 29 (xvi) above). b. Children and their parents have been persecuted for speaking Ukrainian or demonstrating an apparently \u201cpro-Ukrainian\u201d position. Witnesses report FSB officers visiting schools and requesting the teachers to provide the names of children who speak Ukrainian in public. Parents have then been warned by the authorities of the risk of prosecution \u201cfor separatism\u201d. c. On 30 December 2014 the Crimean authorities issued \u201cDecree No. 651\u201d to approve a \u201cState Programme for Development of Education and Science in the Republic of Crimea for 2015-2017\u201d. The programme does not envisage access to education in a native language. d. In 2015 the \u201cMinistry of Education, Science and Youth of Crimea\u201d ordered the administrations of educational establishments to conduct an audit of literature available in libraries and educational premises to determine whether collections included banned items on the Russian Federal List of Extremist Literature (see paragraph 29 (xix) above). Literature with Islamic or Tatar content has been seized and destroyed."

The Court\u2019s obligation, in this respect, is to have regard to the special character of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order for the protection of individual human beings and its role, as set out in Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties (the above-cited Loizidou judgment ( preliminary objections ), at \u00a7 93). It is therefore difficult to contend that a failure to accept the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the respondent States would fall foul of the Convention\u2019s ordre public objective, which itself underlines the essentially regional vocation of the Convention system, or of Article 19 of the Convention which does not shed any particular light on the territorial ambit of that system. It is true that, in its above-cited Cyprus v. Turkey judgment (at \u00a7 78), the Court was conscious of the need to avoid \u201ca regrettable vacuum in the system of human-rights protection\u201d in northern Cyprus. However, and as noted by the Governments, that comment related to an entirely different situation to the present: the inhabitants of northern Cyprus would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the Convention safeguards and system which they had previously enjoyed, by Turkey\u2019s \u201ceffective control\u201d of the territory and by the accompanying inability of the Cypriot Government, as a Contracting State, to fulfil the obligations it had undertaken under the Convention. In short, the Convention is a multi-lateral treaty operating, subject to Article 56 of the Convention , in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space ( espace juridique ) of the Contracting States. The FRY clearly does not fall within this legal space. The Convention was not designed to be applied throughout the world, even in respect of the conduct of Contracting States. Accordingly, the desirability of avoiding a gap or vacuum in human rights\u2019 protection has so far been relied on by the Court in favour of establishing jurisdiction only when the territory in question was one that, but for the specific circumstances, would normally be covered by the Convention."

The system of protection as it now operates has, in that regard, been modified by Protocol No. 11, so that the right of individual application is no longer dependent on a declaration by the Contracting States.

However, and as noted by the Governments, that comment related to an entirely different situation to the present: the inhabitants of northern Cyprus would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the Convention safeguards and system which they had previously enjoyed, by Turkey\u2019s \u201ceffective control\u201d of the territory and by the accompanying inability of the Cypriot Government, as a Contracting State, to fulfil the obligations it had undertaken under the Convention. In short, the Convention is a multi-lateral treaty operating, subject to Article 56 of the Convention , in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space ( espace juridique ) of the Contracting States. The FRY clearly does not fall within this legal space. The Convention was not designed to be applied throughout the world, even in respect of the conduct of Contracting States. Accordingly, the desirability of avoiding a gap or vacuum in human rights\u2019 protection has so far been relied on by the Court in favour of establishing jurisdiction only when the territory in question was one that, but for the specific circumstances, would normally be covered by the Convention."

    "answer": "The Court thus found a violation of Article 13 in the light of Article 5. However, where the Court has found a violation of Article 5 on procedural aspects, it may conclude that it does not need to examine the complaint separately under Article 13, even though it is closely related to the Article 5 complaint and must therefore be declared admissible (Bazorkina v. Russia, 2006, \u00a7 165; Imakayeva v. Russia, 2006, \u00a7 197). The Court takes the view that Article 5 contains a certain number of procedural safeguards related to the lawfulness of detention. Where the relatives of a person have an arguable claim that the latter has disappeared at the hands of the authorities, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure (Kurt v. Turkey, 1998, \u00a7 140).",

In the view of the Court, where the relatives of a person have an arguable claim that the latter has disappeared at the hands of the authorities, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article\u00a013 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Aksoy, Ayd\u0131n and Kaya judgments at p.\u00a02287, \u00a7 98, pp. 1895\u201396, \u00a7 103 and pp. 329\u201331, \u00a7\u00a7 106 and 107, respectively).

The Court will first consider the arguments of the applicants, supported by the third parties, regarding the domestic legal framework as such. The criticism was made that section 160 does not require local authorities to make their own assessment of the proportionality, in terms of Article 8, of the measures sought when they apply to the courts under this provision. However, as the domestic courts have clearly stated, an application is merely a vehicle to bring a complaint before the courts; it does not in itself determine rights or liabilities. It falls to the competent domestic court to examine whether there has been a breach of the planning laws and then, having regard to the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in domestic law, to decide whether or not to exercise its discretion to grant orders (see paragraphs 51 and 55 above). The decision to grant or refuse relief is a judicial function and the courts are under a general obligation, by virtue of Section 2 of the 2003 Act, to interpret domestic law, insofar as is possible, in accordance with the Convention (see paragraph 42 above). A person at risk of losing their home on account of proceedings brought under this statutory provision must be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined judicially, in keeping with the requirements of Article 8. Accordingly, the Court does not consider this specific criticism to be justified."

It is true that all requests for the applicant\u2019s release lodged with the courts were considered speedily. The Court notes, however, that on 27\u00a0May\u00a02002 the applicant\u2019s lawyer provided a number of arguments in support of the applicant\u2019s release (see paragraph 12 above), in particular that the applicant was a minor; had no previous convictions; could not obstruct the collection of evidence or destroy it; had positive aspects to his character; permanently resided in Kerch; did not \u2013 and could not \u2013 try to abscond due to lack of resources or relatives in other parts of the country; and that there was no indication that he would reoffend if released.

However, although the relevant domestic courts ordered the prolongation of the first applicant\u2019s detention at the end of each hearing, there is no evidence in the case file to suggest that the issue of the lawfulness of his initial or continuing detention was subjected to a meaningful examination, which would have required an assessment of the compliance of the detention with domestic procedural requirements, as well as a review of the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest and the ensuing detention (see J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000IX). Not even when it delivered its judgment against the first applicant did the Famagusta Assize Court explain why it had disregarded his allegations of abduction. It simply dismissed his arguments by stating that they were \u201cnot credible\u201d, without giving any further explanation. In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the challenges made by the first applicant against the lawfulness of his detention within the domestic criminal proceedings proved ineffective in the instant case. Moreover, contrary to the Government\u2019s allegation, the fact that he did not explicitly invoke Article 5 of the Convention during those proceedings cannot be held against him, as he raised the substance of his Article\u00a05 complaints before the relevant courts (see Castells v.

The Court will first consider the arguments of the applicants, supported by the third parties, regarding the domestic legal framework as such. The criticism was made that section 160 does not require local authorities to make their own assessment of the proportionality, in terms of Article 8, of the measures sought when they apply to the courts under this provision. However, as the domestic courts have clearly stated, an application is merely a vehicle to bring a complaint before the courts; it does not in itself determine rights or liabilities. It falls to the competent domestic court to examine whether there has been a breach of the planning laws and then, having regard to the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in domestic law, to decide whether or not to exercise its discretion to grant orders (see paragraphs 51 and 55 above). The decision to grant or refuse relief is a judicial function and the courts are under a general obligation, by virtue of Section 2 of the 2003 Act, to interpret domestic law, insofar as is possible, in accordance with the Convention (see paragraph 42 above). A person at risk of losing their home on account of proceedings brought under this statutory provision must be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined judicially, in keeping with the requirements of Article 8. Accordingly, the Court does not consider this specific criticism to be justified."

However, although the relevant domestic courts ordered the prolongation of the first applicant\u2019s detention at the end of each hearing, there is no evidence in the case file to suggest that the issue of the lawfulness of his initial or continuing detention was subjected to a meaningful examination, which would have required an assessment of the compliance of the detention with domestic procedural requirements, as well as a review of the reasonableness of the suspicion underpinning the arrest and the ensuing detention (see J\u0117\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7\u00a0100, ECHR 2000IX).

It simply dismissed his arguments by stating that they were \u201cnot credible\u201d, without giving any further explanation. In those circumstances, the Court is of the view that the challenges made by the first applicant against the lawfulness of his detention within the domestic criminal proceedings proved ineffective in the instant case. Moreover, contrary to the Government\u2019s allegation, the fact that he did not explicitly invoke Article 5 of the Convention during those proceedings cannot be held against him, as he raised the substance of his Article\u00a05 complaints before the relevant courts (see Castells v.

UKRAINE; \u00a7 100: As to the right to review of the lawfulness of the detention guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4, the Court notes that in this and other similar cases previously decided it faced an issue of the domestic courts' failure to provide an adequate response to the applicants' arguments as to the necessity of their release. Despite the existence of the domestic judicial authorities competent to examine such cases and to order release, it appears that without a clear procedure for review of the lawfulness of the detention the above authorities often remain a theoretical rather than practical remedy for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Molodorych v. Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0108, not final). Moreover, speediness of review of the lawfulness of the detention seems to be compromised by the fact that such a review is linked to other procedural steps in the criminal case against the applicant during the investigation and trial, while such procedural steps might not necessarily coincide with the need to decide on the applicant's further detention promptly and with reasonable intervals (see, among many other authorities, Svershov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a070-72, and Sergey Volosyuk, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a05259). Finally, the current legislation does not protect the applicants from arbitrariness, when, like in Yeloyev case, the domestic court refused to look again into the reasonableness of the applicant's detention on the ground that it had ruled on the lawfulness of his detention on several previous occasions, therefore denying the applicant's right to a review of the lawfulness of his detention as guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Yeloyev v.\u00a0Ukraine, cited above, \u00a7 65). The Court considers that these issues should be addressed by the domestic authorities, to avoid further repetitive complaints under this head."

What is crucial is whether, following a concrete assessment of the specific acts, the application of one criminal law rather than the other has put the defendant at a disadvantage as concerns the sentencing (see Maktouf and Damjanovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a069-70).",
          "86": "86.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes at this juncture that, while the applicant\u2019s case is in some respects similar to the case of Maktouf and Damjanovi\u0107 (cited above), in so far as in both cases the courts (i) had established the more lenient criminal law in the context of two competing laws \u2013 that which was in force at the time when the acts were committed and that which entered into force before the applicants were convicted \u2013 by taking into account the specific circumstances in which the particular offences was committed and (ii) had imposed prison sentences which were close to the statutory limits provided for by the relevant legislation, the two cases also present notable differences. In particular, unlike in the case of Maktouf and Damjanovi\u0107, in the applicant\u2019s case the domestic courts took into account in their assessment of the more lenient criminal law not only the statutory maximum and minimum prison sentence that could have been imposed on the applicant, but also the possibility provided for by the new law to impose a fine and the manner in which a sentence was to be served under both the new and the old law \u2013 more specifically, whether the serving of the sentence could be suspended or the imposition of a penalty postponed. The above elements had a bearing on the applicant\u2019s effective right to drive a car. This right was considered of paramount importance by him, given that his earning a living depended on this (see paragraph 27 above).",
          "87": "87.\u00a0\u00a0In this context, the Court notes that in the applicant\u2019s case the definition of the offence concerning the driving of a vehicle on a public road under the influence of alcohol is practically the same in the old criminal law, which was applicable at the time the offence was committed, as in the new criminal legislation, which came into force prior to the applicant\u2019s conviction and which he viewed to be the more lenient criminal law in his case. Moreover, the applicant did not dispute that his actions had constituted a criminal offence defined with sufficient accessibility and foreseeability at the time when it had been committed. The lawfulness of his conviction is therefore not an issue in the instant case.",
          "88": "88.\u00a0\u00a0However, the two criminal laws provide for different sentencing frameworks regarding driving a vehicle on a public road under the influence of alcohol. Under the old criminal law, driving a vehicle under the influence was punishable by imprisonment for a term of one to five years. The courts could suspend the serving of a sentence for the duration of a supervision period if several conditions were met. One or more conditions could also be imposed by the court during the supervision period, including a ban on driving a vehicle. Moreover, the penalty had to be reduced by a third in cases examined under a summary procedure.",
          "89": "89.\u00a0\u00a0Under the new criminal law, driving a vehicle on a public road under the influence of alcohol attracts imprisonment for a term of one to five years or a fine. The courts may waive or postpone the imposition of a penalty, or suspend the serving of a sentence for the duration of a supervision period if several conditions are met. One or more conditions may also be imposed by the court during the supervision period. Where the court decides to postpone the imposition of a penalty, one of the conditions which may be imposed on a person found guilty of an offence during the supervision period includes a ban on driving certain vehicles. Moreover, the penalty has to be reduced by a third in cases examined under a summary procedure where the penalty is imprisonment.",
          "90": "90.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that an overall comparison of the punitive regime under each of the criminal laws applicable to the applicant shows that the only presumed penalty which could be imposed in his case under the old criminal law was imprisonment for a term of one to five years. By contrast, under the new criminal law the domestic courts could choose between imprisonment for a term of one to five years and a fine. Moreover, even though both criminal laws provided, subject to certain conditions, that the sentence imposed on the alleged offender could be suspended and/or reduced, only the new criminal law provided that the imposition of the sentence could be waived or postponed.",
          "91": "91.\u00a0\u00a0The Court further notes that a long or maximum prison sentence is subject to a more stringent regime under the new criminal law than under the old law because, under the new criminal law, any prison sentence over three years has to be served.",
          "92": "92.\u00a0\u00a0In these circumstances, the Court will examine whether the specific assessment made by the last-instance court in the applicant\u2019s case, which led to the application of the old criminal law, could reasonably be considered the most favourable for him in terms of sentencing.",
          "93": "93.\u00a0\u00a0The Court observes in this regard that the last-instance court considered the general sentencing criteria set out in both the new and old criminal law and applied them to the particular circumstances in which the applicant had committed the offence. It accepted the prosecutor\u2019s office\u2019s arguments that the offence committed by him was serious and pointed out that the sentence imposed on him by the first-instance court had not been appropriate to ensure his rehabilitation. It then sentenced the applicant to the maximum sentence provided for by the old criminal law, namely three years and four months\u2019 imprisonment. Had the new criminal law been applied, the maximum prison sentence imposed on the applicant would have been the same.",
          "94": "94.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that the applicant argued that the new criminal law had been more lenient for him than the old criminal law, given that under the newer provision the courts had had the option to sentence him to a fine. The Court also notes, however, that none of the courts which examined his case took the view that a fine could be imposed in his case given the particular circumstances of the incident he was involved in. In so far as his argument may be understood to amount to a general complaint about the severity of the penalty imposed on him by the last-instance court, the Court reiterates that issues relating to the appropriateness of a penalty do not fall within the scope of Article 7, as it is not the Court\u2019s role to decide the length of a prison sentence or the type of penalty which is suited to any given offence (see Hummatov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 18\u00a0May 2006; Hakkar v. France (dec.), no. 43580/04, 7 April 2009; and Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09 and 2 others, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).",
          "95": "95.\u00a0\u00a0What is important for the Court is whether there was a real possibility that the applicant could have received a more favourable sentence had the new criminal law been applied in his case. As already observed above (see paragraph 93) the last-instance court did not consider the offence minor and sentenced him to the maximum prison sentence, which was over three\u00a0years. The Court notes at this point that the new criminal law requires that the offence under examination be minor or that the prison sentences set for or imposed on defendants be three years or less for the various manners in which a sentence is to be served to take effect and to be applicable in any given case. Since in the applicant\u2019s case the offence committed by him and the prison sentence imposed on him did not meet these requirements, he would have been forced to serve his prison sentence had the new criminal law been applied.",
          "96": "96.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Court finds nothing to support the applicant\u2019s allegation that the last-instance court applied the more stringent criminal law in his case. On the contrary, since there was no obvious possibility that the application of the new criminal law would have operated to his advantage as concerns sentencing, it cannot be said that he was not afforded effective safeguards against the imposition of a heavier penalty.",
          "97": "97.\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s conclusion is not affected by the fact that when the last-instance court reduced the applicant\u2019s prison sentence by a third, it referred to the new criminal procedure rules concerning the length of the sentence to be imposed when a case had been dealt with under a simplified procedure (see paragraph 34 above). Similar provisions were also available under the old criminal law and would have had the same effect as regards the applicant\u2019s sentence. Therefore, the Court considers that the approach of the last-instance court could not be viewed as an unlawful attempt to create a new law (see paragraph 44 above) or that it has produced consequences that are inconsistent with the Convention requirements.",
          "98": "98.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Court considers that there has been no violation of Article\u00a07 of the Convention in the particular circumstances of the present case."

    "answer": "The principle of legal certainty requires domestic authorities to respect the binding nature of a final judicial decision. However, the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute. In criminal cases, they must be assessed in the light of, for example, Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7, which expressly permits a State to reopen a case due to the emergence of new facts, or where a fundamental defect is detected in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case. Nevertheless, compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 is not in itself sufficient to establish compliance with the requirements of a fair trial under Article 6 (Nikitin v. Russia, 2004, \u00a7 56). Certain special circumstances of the case may reveal that the actual manner in which the procedure for reopening of a final decision was used impaired the very essence of a fair trial. In particular, the Court has to assess whether, in a given case, the power to launch and conduct such a procedure was exercised by the authorities so as to strike, to the maximum extent possible, a fair balance between the interests of the individual and the need to ensure the effectiveness of the system of criminal justice (ibid., \u00a7 57).",

The Court has emphasised that the requirements of legal certainty are not absolute, in particular in criminal proceedings. In such cases, they must be assessed in the light of, for example, Article 4 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 7, which expressly permits a State to reopen a case if new facts emerge, or where a fundamental defect which could have affected the outcome of the case is detected in previous proceedings (see Nikitin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a055 and 56). The possibility of re-examining or reopening cases has also been considered by the Committee of Ministers as a means of achieving restitutio in integrum, particularly in the context of the execution of the Court\u2019s judgments. In its Recommendation No. R (2000) 2 on the re-examination or reopening of certain cases at the domestic level following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, it encouraged the Contracting Parties to review their domestic legal systems with a view to ensuring that adequate opportunity for the re-examination of a case, including reopening of proceedings, exists in instances where the Court has found a violation of the Convention."

Accordingly, the Court has held that the mere possibility of reopening a criminal case is prima facie compatible with the Convention (see Nikitin v.\u00a0Russia, no. 50178/99, \u00a7\u00a7 55-57, ECHR 2004VIII). However, it has emphasised that higher courts\u2019 power of review should only be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, and not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. A departure from that principle is justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Bujni\u0163a v. Moldova, no. 36492/02, \u00a7 20, 16 January 2007, and Bota v.\u00a0Romania, no. 16382/03, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 34, 4 November 2008)."

    "question": "In the context of criminal proceedings, if a person charged with a criminal offence is excluded from the proceedings where their guilt is determined, how does the principle of an oral and public hearing, and the specific rights under Article 6, such as the right to \"defend himself in person\" and \"to examine or have examined witnesses\", apply?",
    "answer": "The principle of an oral and public hearing is particularly important in the criminal context, where a person charged with a criminal offence must generally be able to attend a hearing at first instance (Jussila v. Finland [GC], 2006, \u00a7 40; Tierce and Others v. San Marino, 2000, \u00a7 94; Igor Pascari v. the Republic of Moldova, 2016, \u00a7 27, concerning the applicant\u2019s exclusion from the proceedings in which his guilt for a road traffic accident had been determined). Without being present, it is difficult to see how that person could exercise the specific rights set out in sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3 of Article 6, namely the right to \u201cdefend himself in person\u201d, \u201cto examine or have examined witnesses\u201d and \u201cto have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court\u201d. The duty to guarantee the right of a criminal defendant to be present in the courtroom ranks therefore as one of the essential requirements of Article 6 (Hermi v. Italy [GC], 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 58-59; Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 84; Arps v. Croatia, 2016, \u00a7 28).",

It further notes that it is clear from the case file that the Bender Court of Appeal determined, inter alia, that the applicant was responsible for causing the accident of 14 August 2009. Although that finding did not amount to a final determination of his guilt, it had a decisive effect on such a determination. Indeed, the police based its decision of 22 January 2010 entirely on the conclusions reached by the Bender District Court of 19 November 2009 without making any further investigation or reaching any new conclusions of its own (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). In fact, the chief inspector was obliged to conform to the to the appeal court\u2019s judgment and could not have reached any other conclusion. Moreover, the judgment of 19\u00a0November 2009 had the effect of res judicata in respect of both the applicant and P.C., if only for making the latter immune from responsibility for the accident. Since in a car accident involving two vehicles, there should be at least one person responsible, the final exclusion of P.C.\u2019s responsibility by the Bender Court of Appeal implicitly predetermined the applicant\u2019s guilt. In those circumstances, the Court must conclude that there has been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention."

    "answer": "In the context of implementing facial recognition technology, the Court emphasised that, for the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement to be met, it was essential to have detailed rules governing the scope and application of measures as well as strong safeguards against the risk of abuse and arbitrariness. The need for safeguards will be all the greater where the use of live facial recognition technology is concerned (Glukhin v. Russia, 2023, \u00a7 82). In this case, where the Court for the first time addressed the issue of the use of such technology, it expressed strong doubts that the domestic legal provisions which authorised the processing of biometric personal data, including with the aid of facial recognition technology, \u201cin connection with the administration of justice\u201d met the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement, since they were widely formulated and would appear to allow processing of such data in connection with any type of judicial proceedings. Domestic law did not contain any limitations on the nature of situations which might give rise to the use of facial recognition technology, the intended purposes, the categories of person who might be targeted, or on the processing of sensitive personal data. Moreover, there would appear to be no procedural safeguards accompanying the use of facial recognition technology, such as authorisation procedures, procedures to be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained, supervisory control mechanisms or available remedies (ibid., \u00a7 83).",

This legal provision is widely formulated. Taking into account that the Government did not refer to any authoritative interpretation of that provision by the Supreme or Constitutional Courts or submit any examples of its restrictive interpretation and application in administrative and judicial practice, it appears that it allows processing of biometric personal data \u2013 including with the aid of facial recognition technology \u2013 in connection with any judicial proceedings. The domestic law does not contain any limitations on the nature of situations which may give rise to the use of facial recognition technology, the intended purposes, the categories of people who may be targeted, or on processing of sensitive personal data. Furthermore, the Government did not refer to any procedural safeguards accompanying the use of facial recognition technology in Russia, such as the authorisation procedures, the procedures to be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained, supervisory control mechanisms and available remedies."

                "paragraph_text": "CASE OF GLUKHIN v. RUSSIA; \u00a7 39: . Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55. An act of law has to lay down substantive and procedural conditions and objective criteria by which to determine the limits of competent authorities\u2019 access to data and their subsequent use. For the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions, the offences concerned would have to be considered sufficiently serious to justify the extent and seriousness of these interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined for example in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. 56. The data has to be processed in a way that ensures the applicability and effect of the EU data protection rules; in particular those provided by Article 8 of the Charter, which states that the compliance with the requirements of protection and security shall be subject to control by an independent authority. The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73. Processing can only be regarded as \"strictly necessary\" if the interference to the protection of personal data and its restrictions is limited to what is absolutely necessary. The addition of the term \u201cstrictly\u201d means that the legislator intended the processing of special categories of data to only take place under conditions even stricter than the conditions for necessity. This requirement should be interpreted as being indispensable. It restricts the margin of appreciation permitted to the law enforcement authority in the necessity test to an absolute minimum. In accordance with the settled case-law of the CJEU, the condition of \u201cstrict necessity\u201d is also closely linked to the requirement of objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which processing can be undertaken, thus excluding any processing of a general or systematic nature ... 104. The use of facial recognition technologies is intrinsically linked to processing of significant amounts of personal data, including special categories of data. The face and, more generally, biometric data are permanently and irrevocably linked to a person\u2019s identity. Therefore, the use of facial recognition has direct or indirect impact on a number of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that may go beyond privacy and data protection, such as human dignity, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and others. This is particularly relevant in the area of law enforcement and criminal justice. 105. The EDPB understands the need for law enforcement authorities to benefit from the best possible tools to quickly identify the perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes. However, such tools should be used in strict compliance with the applicable legal framework and only in cases when they satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality, as laid down in Article 52(1) of the Charter. Moreover, while modern technologies may be part of the solution, they are by no means a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. 106. There are certain use cases of facial recognition technologies, which pose unacceptably high risks to individuals and society (\u2018red lines\u2019). For these reasons the EDPB and the EDPS have called for their general ban. 107. In particular, remote biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces poses a high risk of intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives and does not have a place in a democratic society, as by its nature, it entails mass surveillance. In the same vein, the EDPB considers AI-supported facial recognition systems categorising individuals based on their biometrics into clusters according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation as not compatible with the Charter. Furthermore, the EDPB is convinced that the use of facial recognition or similar technologies, to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, possibly with few duly justified exceptions. In addition, the EDPB considers that processing of personal data in a law enforcement context that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way, e.g. by \"scraping\" photographs and facial pictures accessible online, in particular those made available via social networks, would, as such, not meet the strict necessity requirement provided for by Union law.\u201d OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL"

Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55.

Russia (App. No. 41863/16, Doc 1), the ECtHR stated that Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention requires laws to provide \"adequate and effective protective measures\" against any potential harm to individuals' private life, and laws must be applied and interpreted strictly.\nThis reinforces the \"quality of law\" requirement, which is crucial in determining whether a law has been applied in a manner that is consistent with the purpose of a Convention provision.\nIn the case of Gaughran v. the United Kingdom (App. No. 45245/15, Doc 2), the ECtHR recognized the difficulty of proving the use of facial recognition technology in cases where the domestic legislation does not require official records or the provision of such records to the individual concerned, on request or automatically.\nHowever, the Court has noted instances where the use of facial recognition technology has been inferred from the rapid identification of individuals (see Vasiliyeva v. Russia,).\nHere, the quality of law is questioned, as the absence of a clear record of its use raises concerns about the legal restrictions in place for its application, if any.\nMoreover, the case of Guliyeva v. Russia (App. No. 61828/13, Doc 3) illustrates that although the individual, in this case a minor, was not explicitly identified by name, it was not reasonable for the applicant to assume that her image was processed using facial recognition technology.\nThis assumption was supported by numerous other cases reported in the press.\nIn the case of Article 19 v. Russia (App. No. 32988/09, Doc 4), the ECtHR stressed the importance of clear legal provisions on the use of live facial recognition technologies and the potential risks to fundamental rights and freedoms.\nSimilarly, in Guidelines on Facial Recognition (2021) by the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS 108) (Doc 9), it is recommended to ensure that the development and use of facial recognition technologies respect the rights to privacy and protection of personal data by strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms through implementing the principles enshrined in the Convention.\nIn the case of an unspecified applicant v. Russia (App. No. 62574/13, Doc 7), the ECtHR highlighted the importance of strict necessity and proportionality tests being applied when creating databases (watch lists) for specific, legitimate, and explicit law enforcement purposes.\nWhile specific data protection laws are not applicable in Russia in all cases, as stated in the case of Guliyeva v. Russia (see paras 50-51, Doc 3), the ECtHR still emphasizes the need for compliance with the \"quality of law\" requirement to ensure the protection of individuals' privacy rights under Article 8 of the Convention.\nIn summary, the European Court of Human Rights assesses the compliance of domestic measures authorizing the processing of biometric personal data, including facial recognition technology, with the \"quality of law\" requirement under Article 8 of the Convention by examining the strictness and transparency of the legal framework and ensuring strong safeguards for individuals' privacy rights.",

The Court finds it to be beyond dispute that the fight against crime, and in particular against organised crime and terrorism, which is one of the challenges faced by today\u2019s European societies, depends to a great extent on the use of modern scientific techniques of investigation and identification. However, while it recognises the importance of such techniques in the detection and investigation of crime, the Court must delimit the scope of its examination. The question is not whether the processing of biometric personal data by facial recognition technology may in general be regarded as justified under the Convention. The only issue to be considered by the Court is whether the processing of the applicant\u2019s personal data was justified under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention in the present case (compare S. and Marper , cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 105-06)."

                "paragraph_text": "CASE OF GLUKHIN v. RUSSIA; \u00a7 39: . Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55. An act of law has to lay down substantive and procedural conditions and objective criteria by which to determine the limits of competent authorities\u2019 access to data and their subsequent use. For the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions, the offences concerned would have to be considered sufficiently serious to justify the extent and seriousness of these interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined for example in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. 56. The data has to be processed in a way that ensures the applicability and effect of the EU data protection rules; in particular those provided by Article 8 of the Charter, which states that the compliance with the requirements of protection and security shall be subject to control by an independent authority. The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73. Processing can only be regarded as \"strictly necessary\" if the interference to the protection of personal data and its restrictions is limited to what is absolutely necessary. The addition of the term \u201cstrictly\u201d means that the legislator intended the processing of special categories of data to only take place under conditions even stricter than the conditions for necessity. This requirement should be interpreted as being indispensable. It restricts the margin of appreciation permitted to the law enforcement authority in the necessity test to an absolute minimum. In accordance with the settled case-law of the CJEU, the condition of \u201cstrict necessity\u201d is also closely linked to the requirement of objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which processing can be undertaken, thus excluding any processing of a general or systematic nature ... 104. The use of facial recognition technologies is intrinsically linked to processing of significant amounts of personal data, including special categories of data. The face and, more generally, biometric data are permanently and irrevocably linked to a person\u2019s identity. Therefore, the use of facial recognition has direct or indirect impact on a number of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that may go beyond privacy and data protection, such as human dignity, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and others. This is particularly relevant in the area of law enforcement and criminal justice. 105. The EDPB understands the need for law enforcement authorities to benefit from the best possible tools to quickly identify the perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes. However, such tools should be used in strict compliance with the applicable legal framework and only in cases when they satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality, as laid down in Article 52(1) of the Charter. Moreover, while modern technologies may be part of the solution, they are by no means a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. 106. There are certain use cases of facial recognition technologies, which pose unacceptably high risks to individuals and society (\u2018red lines\u2019). For these reasons the EDPB and the EDPS have called for their general ban. 107. In particular, remote biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces poses a high risk of intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives and does not have a place in a democratic society, as by its nature, it entails mass surveillance. In the same vein, the EDPB considers AI-supported facial recognition systems categorising individuals based on their biometrics into clusters according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation as not compatible with the Charter. Furthermore, the EDPB is convinced that the use of facial recognition or similar technologies, to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, possibly with few duly justified exceptions. In addition, the EDPB considers that processing of personal data in a law enforcement context that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way, e.g. by \"scraping\" photographs and facial pictures accessible online, in particular those made available via social networks, would, as such, not meet the strict necessity requirement provided for by Union law.\u201d OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL"

The Court has previously found that the storage of photographs by the police, coupled with a possibility of applying facial recognition techniques to them, constituted an interference with the right to private life (see Gaughran v. the United Kingdom , no. 45245/15, \u00a7\u00a7 69-70, 13 February 2020)."

Furthermore, any use of audiovisual recording and facial recognition technology must be subject to robust and well-resourced oversight mechanisms. While part of the oversight can be carried out by independent and impartial data protection authorities, States should consider additional measures, including the involvement of an independent body, preferably of a judicial nature, in charge of authorizing the use of facial recognition technology measures in an assembly context. In any case, any use of recording and facial recognition technology should be open to judicial challenge. In all circumstances, the authorities should be transparent about the use of recording and facial recognition technology and always notify members of the public when they are, or may be, recorded and/or when their images may be processed in a facial recognition system. ... 53. In this context, the High Commissioner recommends that States: ... (h) Never use facial recognition technology to identify those peacefully participating in an assembly; (i) Refrain from recording footage of assembly participants, unless there are concrete indications that participants are engaging in, or will engage in, serious criminal activity, and such recording is provided by law, with the necessary robust safeguards;\u201d COUNCIL OF EUROPE 36 .

The collection of personal data for police purposes should be limited to such as is necessary for the prevention of a real danger or the suppression of a specific criminal offence. Any exception to this provision should be the subject of specific national legislation. ... 2.4. The collection of data on individuals solely on the basis that they have a particular racial origin, particular religious convictions, sexual behaviour or political opinions or belong to particular movements or organisations which are not proscribed by law should be prohibited. The collection of data concerning these factors may only be carried out if absolutely necessary for the purposes of a particular inquiry.\u201d 37 . The Guidelines on Facial Recognition (2021) by the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS 108) provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201cFacial recognition is the automatic processing of digital images containing individuals\u2019 faces for identification or verification of those individuals by using face templates. The sensitivity of information of a biometric nature was recognised explicitly with the inclusion of data uniquely identifying a person under the special categories of data in Article 6 of the modernised Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (hereinafter \u2018Convention 108+\u2019). The context of the processing of images is relevant to the determination of the sensitive nature of the data, as not all processing of images involves the processing of sensitive data. Images shall only be covered by the definition of biometric data when they are processed through a specific technical means which permits the unique identification or authentication of an individual. These guidelines cover uses of facial recognition technologies, including live facial recognition technologies. ... Integrating facial recognition technologies into existing surveillance systems poses a serious risk to the rights to privacy and protection of personal data, as well as to other fundamental rights, since use of these technologies does not always require the awareness or co-operation of the individuals whose biometric data are processed in this way. This is the case, for instance, with the possibility to access digital images of individuals on the internet. In order to prevent such infringements, the parties to Convention 108+ shall ensure that the development and use of facial recognition respect the rights to privacy and personal data protection, thereby strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms by implementing the principles enshrined in the Convention in the specific context of facial recognition technologies. ... Lawfulness As provided for by Article 6 of Convention 108+, the processing of special categories of data, such as biometric data, shall only be authorised if such processing relies on an appropriate legal basis, and if complementary and appropriate safeguards are enshrined in domestic law. These safeguards shall be adapted to the risks involved and to the interests, rights and freedoms to be protected. In some legislation, the prohibition of such processing is a rule and its implementation is allowed only by way of exception, in certain specific cases (for example, with the explicit consent of individuals, to protect their vital interests or when the processing is necessary for reasons of overriding public interest), and subject to safeguards that are appropriate to the risks involved. The necessity for the use of facial recognition technologies has to be assessed together with the proportionality to the purpose and the impact on the rights of the data subjects. The different cases of use should be categorised and a legal framework applicable to the processing of biometric data through facial recognition should be in place. This legal framework should address, for each different use, in particular: - a detailed explanation of the specific use and the intended purpose; - the minimum reliability and accuracy of the algorithm used; - the retention duration of the photos used; - the possibility of auditing these criteria; - the traceability of the process; - the safeguards. Strict limitation of certain uses by law The level of intrusiveness of facial recognition and related infringement of the rights to privacy and data protection will vary according to the particular use and there will be cases where domestic law will strictly limit or even completely prohibit its use where that decision has been reached through the democratic process. The use of live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, in light of its intrusiveness on the right to privacy and the dignity of individuals, coupled with the risk of an adverse impact on other human rights and fundamental freedoms, should be subject to a democratic debate and the possibility of a moratorium pending a full analysis. ... Integrating digital images into facial recognition technologies Legislators and decision makers shall ensure that images available in a digital format cannot be processed to extract biometric templates, or to integrate them into biometric systems, without a specific legal basis for the new processing, when those images were initially captured for other purposes (from social media, for instance). As extracting biometric templates from digital images involves the processing of sensitive data, it is necessary to ensure the possible legal basis considered below, which varies according to the different sectors and uses. Specifically, using digital images that were uploaded onto the internet, including social media or online photo management websites, or that were captured by video surveillance cameras, cannot be considered lawful on the sole basis that the personal data were made manifestly available by the data subjects. ... Use of facial recognition technologies in the public sector Consent should not, as a rule, be the legal ground used for facial recognition performed by public authorities in view of the imbalance of powers between the data subjects and these authorities. ... Legislators and decision makers have to lay down specific rules for biometric processing using facial recognition technologies for law enforcement purposes. These rules will ensure that such uses must be strictly necessary and proportionate to these purposes and prescribe the necessary safeguards to be provided. Law enforcement authorities Biometric data processing using facial recognition technologies for identification purposes in a controlled or uncontrolled environment should be restricted, in general, to law enforcement purposes. It should be carried out solely by the competent authorities in the area of security. Laws may provide for different necessity and proportionality tests depending on whether the purpose is verification or identification, taking into account the potential risks to fundamental rights and as long as individuals\u2019 images are lawfully collected. For identification purposes, strict necessity and proportionality shall be observed both in the setting up of the database (watch list) and deployment of (live) facial recognition technologies in an uncontrolled environment. Laws should provide clear parameters and criteria that law enforcement authorities should adhere to when creating databases (watch lists) for specific, legitimate and explicit law enforcement purposes (for example, suspicion of severe offences or a risk to public security). Considering the intrusiveness of these technologies, in the deployment phase of the live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, the law shall ensure that law enforcement authorities demonstrate that a variety of factors, including the place and timing of deployment of these technologies, justify the strict necessity and proportionality of the uses. ...\u201d European Union"

Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55. An act of law has to lay down substantive and procedural conditions and objective criteria by which to determine the limits of competent authorities\u2019 access to data and their subsequent use. For the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions, the offences concerned would have to be considered sufficiently serious to justify the extent and seriousness of these interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined for example in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. 56. The data has to be processed in a way that ensures the applicability and effect of the EU data protection rules; in particular those provided by Article 8 of the Charter, which states that the compliance with the requirements of protection and security shall be subject to control by an independent authority. The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73. Processing can only be regarded as \"strictly necessary\" if the interference to the protection of personal data and its restrictions is limited to what is absolutely necessary. The addition of the term \u201cstrictly\u201d means that the legislator intended the processing of special categories of data to only take place under conditions even stricter than the conditions for necessity. This requirement should be interpreted as being indispensable. It restricts the margin of appreciation permitted to the law enforcement authority in the necessity test to an absolute minimum. In accordance with the settled case-law of the CJEU, the condition of \u201cstrict necessity\u201d is also closely linked to the requirement of objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which processing can be undertaken, thus excluding any processing of a general or systematic nature ... 104. The use of facial recognition technologies is intrinsically linked to processing of significant amounts of personal data, including special categories of data. The face and, more generally, biometric data are permanently and irrevocably linked to a person\u2019s identity. Therefore, the use of facial recognition has direct or indirect impact on a number of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that may go beyond privacy and data protection, such as human dignity, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and others. This is particularly relevant in the area of law enforcement and criminal justice. 105. The EDPB understands the need for law enforcement authorities to benefit from the best possible tools to quickly identify the perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes. However, such tools should be used in strict compliance with the applicable legal framework and only in cases when they satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality, as laid down in Article 52(1) of the Charter. Moreover, while modern technologies may be part of the solution, they are by no means a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. 106. There are certain use cases of facial recognition technologies, which pose unacceptably high risks to individuals and society (\u2018red lines\u2019). For these reasons the EDPB and the EDPS have called for their general ban. 107. In particular, remote biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces poses a high risk of intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives and does not have a place in a democratic society, as by its nature, it entails mass surveillance. In the same vein, the EDPB considers AI-supported facial recognition systems categorising individuals based on their biometrics into clusters according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation as not compatible with the Charter. Furthermore, the EDPB is convinced that the use of facial recognition or similar technologies, to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, possibly with few duly justified exceptions. In addition, the EDPB considers that processing of personal data in a law enforcement context that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way, e.g. by \"scraping\" photographs and facial pictures accessible online, in particular those made available via social networks, would, as such, not meet the strict necessity requirement provided for by Union law.\u201d OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL"

Furthermore, any use of audiovisual recording and facial recognition technology must be subject to robust and well-resourced oversight mechanisms. While part of the oversight can be carried out by independent and impartial data protection authorities, States should consider additional measures, including the involvement of an independent body, preferably of a judicial nature, in charge of authorizing the use of facial recognition technology measures in an assembly context. In any case, any use of recording and facial recognition technology should be open to judicial challenge. In all circumstances, the authorities should be transparent about the use of recording and facial recognition technology and always notify members of the public when they are, or may be, recorded and/or when their images may be processed in a facial recognition system. ... 53. In this context, the High Commissioner recommends that States: ... (h) Never use facial recognition technology to identify those peacefully participating in an assembly; (i) Refrain from recording footage of assembly participants, unless there are concrete indications that participants are engaging in, or will engage in, serious criminal activity, and such recording is provided by law, with the necessary robust safeguards;\u201d COUNCIL OF EUROPE 36 . Recommendation No. R (87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers regulating the use of personal data in the police sector (adopted on 17 September 1987) states, inter alia : \u201cPrinciple 2 \u2013 Collection of data 2.1. The collection of personal data for police purposes should be limited to such as is necessary for the prevention of a real danger or the suppression of a specific criminal offence. Any exception to this provision should be the subject of specific national legislation. ... 2.4. The collection of data on individuals solely on the basis that they have a particular racial origin, particular religious convictions, sexual behaviour or political opinions or belong to particular movements or organisations which are not proscribed by law should be prohibited. The collection of data concerning these factors may only be carried out if absolutely necessary for the purposes of a particular inquiry.\u201d 37 . The Guidelines on Facial Recognition (2021) by the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS 108) provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201cFacial recognition is the automatic processing of digital images containing individuals\u2019 faces for identification or verification of those individuals by using face templates. The sensitivity of information of a biometric nature was recognised explicitly with the inclusion of data uniquely identifying a person under the special categories of data in Article 6 of the modernised Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data (hereinafter \u2018Convention 108+\u2019). The context of the processing of images is relevant to the determination of the sensitive nature of the data, as not all processing of images involves the processing of sensitive data. Images shall only be covered by the definition of biometric data when they are processed through a specific technical means which permits the unique identification or authentication of an individual. These guidelines cover uses of facial recognition technologies, including live facial recognition technologies. ... Integrating facial recognition technologies into existing surveillance systems poses a serious risk to the rights to privacy and protection of personal data, as well as to other fundamental rights, since use of these technologies does not always require the awareness or co-operation of the individuals whose biometric data are processed in this way. This is the case, for instance, with the possibility to access digital images of individuals on the internet. In order to prevent such infringements, the parties to Convention 108+ shall ensure that the development and use of facial recognition respect the rights to privacy and personal data protection, thereby strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms by implementing the principles enshrined in the Convention in the specific context of facial recognition technologies. ... Lawfulness As provided for by Article 6 of Convention 108+, the processing of special categories of data, such as biometric data, shall only be authorised if such processing relies on an appropriate legal basis, and if complementary and appropriate safeguards are enshrined in domestic law. These safeguards shall be adapted to the risks involved and to the interests, rights and freedoms to be protected. In some legislation, the prohibition of such processing is a rule and its implementation is allowed only by way of exception, in certain specific cases (for example, with the explicit consent of individuals, to protect their vital interests or when the processing is necessary for reasons of overriding public interest), and subject to safeguards that are appropriate to the risks involved. The necessity for the use of facial recognition technologies has to be assessed together with the proportionality to the purpose and the impact on the rights of the data subjects. The different cases of use should be categorised and a legal framework applicable to the processing of biometric data through facial recognition should be in place. This legal framework should address, for each different use, in particular: - a detailed explanation of the specific use and the intended purpose; - the minimum reliability and accuracy of the algorithm used; - the retention duration of the photos used; - the possibility of auditing these criteria; - the traceability of the process; - the safeguards. Strict limitation of certain uses by law The level of intrusiveness of facial recognition and related infringement of the rights to privacy and data protection will vary according to the particular use and there will be cases where domestic law will strictly limit or even completely prohibit its use where that decision has been reached through the democratic process. The use of live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, in light of its intrusiveness on the right to privacy and the dignity of individuals, coupled with the risk of an adverse impact on other human rights and fundamental freedoms, should be subject to a democratic debate and the possibility of a moratorium pending a full analysis. ... Integrating digital images into facial recognition technologies Legislators and decision makers shall ensure that images available in a digital format cannot be processed to extract biometric templates, or to integrate them into biometric systems, without a specific legal basis for the new processing, when those images were initially captured for other purposes (from social media, for instance). As extracting biometric templates from digital images involves the processing of sensitive data, it is necessary to ensure the possible legal basis considered below, which varies according to the different sectors and uses. Specifically, using digital images that were uploaded onto the internet, including social media or online photo management websites, or that were captured by video surveillance cameras, cannot be considered lawful on the sole basis that the personal data were made manifestly available by the data subjects. ... Use of facial recognition technologies in the public sector Consent should not, as a rule, be the legal ground used for facial recognition performed by public authorities in view of the imbalance of powers between the data subjects and these authorities. ... Legislators and decision makers have to lay down specific rules for biometric processing using facial recognition technologies for law enforcement purposes. These rules will ensure that such uses must be strictly necessary and proportionate to these purposes and prescribe the necessary safeguards to be provided. Law enforcement authorities Biometric data processing using facial recognition technologies for identification purposes in a controlled or uncontrolled environment should be restricted, in general, to law enforcement purposes. It should be carried out solely by the competent authorities in the area of security. Laws may provide for different necessity and proportionality tests depending on whether the purpose is verification or identification, taking into account the potential risks to fundamental rights and as long as individuals\u2019 images are lawfully collected. For identification purposes, strict necessity and proportionality shall be observed both in the setting up of the database (watch list) and deployment of (live) facial recognition technologies in an uncontrolled environment. Laws should provide clear parameters and criteria that law enforcement authorities should adhere to when creating databases (watch lists) for specific, legitimate and explicit law enforcement purposes (for example, suspicion of severe offences or a risk to public security). Considering the intrusiveness of these technologies, in the deployment phase of the live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, the law shall ensure that law enforcement authorities demonstrate that a variety of factors, including the place and timing of deployment of these technologies, justify the strict necessity and proportionality of the uses. ...\u201d European Union"

The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73. Processing can only be regarded as \"strictly necessary\" if the interference to the protection of personal data and its restrictions is limited to what is absolutely necessary. The addition of the term \u201cstrictly\u201d means that the legislator intended the processing of special categories of data to only take place under conditions even stricter than the conditions for necessity. This requirement should be interpreted as being indispensable. It restricts the margin of appreciation permitted to the law enforcement authority in the necessity test to an absolute minimum. In accordance with the settled case-law of the CJEU, the condition of \u201cstrict necessity\u201d is also closely linked to the requirement of objective criteria in order to define the circumstances and conditions under which processing can be undertaken, thus excluding any processing of a general or systematic nature ... 104. The use of facial recognition technologies is intrinsically linked to processing of significant amounts of personal data, including special categories of data. The face and, more generally, biometric data are permanently and irrevocably linked to a person\u2019s identity. Therefore, the use of facial recognition has direct or indirect impact on a number of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that may go beyond privacy and data protection, such as human dignity, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and others. This is particularly relevant in the area of law enforcement and criminal justice. 105. The EDPB understands the need for law enforcement authorities to benefit from the best possible tools to quickly identify the perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes. However, such tools should be used in strict compliance with the applicable legal framework and only in cases when they satisfy the requirements of necessity and proportionality, as laid down in Article 52(1) of the Charter. Moreover, while modern technologies may be part of the solution, they are by no means a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. 106. There are certain use cases of facial recognition technologies, which pose unacceptably high risks to individuals and society (\u2018red lines\u2019). For these reasons the EDPB and the EDPS have called for their general ban. 107. In particular, remote biometric identification of individuals in publicly accessible spaces poses a high risk of intrusion into individuals\u2019 private lives and does not have a place in a democratic society, as by its nature, it entails mass surveillance. In the same vein, the EDPB considers AI-supported facial recognition systems categorising individuals based on their biometrics into clusters according to ethnicity, gender, as well as political or sexual orientation as not compatible with the Charter. Furthermore, the EDPB is convinced that the use of facial recognition or similar technologies, to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, possibly with few duly justified exceptions. In addition, the EDPB considers that processing of personal data in a law enforcement context that would rely on a database populated by collection of personal data on a mass-scale and in an indiscriminate way, e.g. by \"scraping\" photographs and facial pictures accessible online, in particular those made available via social networks, would, as such, not meet the strict necessity requirement provided for by Union law.\u201d OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL"

Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement of 26 April 2023 by the European Data Protection Board provide as follows (footnotes omitted): \u201c36. The processing of biometric data under all circumstances constitutes a serious interference in itself. This does not depend on the outcome, e.g. a positive matching. The processing constitutes an interference even if the biometric template is immediately deleted after the matching against a police database results in a no-hit ... 43. Article 52(1) of the Charter sets the requirement of a specific legal basis. This legal basis must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of collection of data and secret surveillance. It must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection as entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society. Moreover, lawfulness requires adequate safeguards to ensure that in particular an individual\u2019s right under Article 8 of the Charter is respected. These principles also apply to the processing of personal data for purposes of evaluating, training and further developing of FRT systems. 44. Given that biometric data when processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person constitute special categories of data listed in Article 10 LED, the different applications of FRT in most cases would require a dedicated law precisely describing the application and the conditions for its use. This encompasses in particular the types of crime and, where applicable, the appropriate threshold of severity of these crimes, in order to, among other things, effectively exclude petty crime ... 51. According to the CJEU\u2019s settled case-law, derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary. This also implies that there are no less intrusive means available to achieve the purpose. Possible alternatives such as \u2013 depending on the given purpose \u2013 additional staffing, more frequent policing or additional street lighting have to be carefully identified and assessed. Legislative measures should differentiate and target those persons covered by it in the light of the objective, e.g. fighting serious crime. If it covers all persons in a general manner without such differentiation, limitation or exception, it intensifies the interference. It also intensifies the interference if the data processing covers a significant part of the population. 52. The protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter. Legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and impose safeguards so that the persons whose data have been processed have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access or use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal data is subject to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to the data. Furthermore, internal or external, e.g. judicial, authorisation of the deployment of FRT may also contribute as safeguards, and may prove to be necessary in certain cases of severe interference. 53. The rules laid down have to be adapted to the specific situation, e.g. the quantity of data processed, the nature of the data and the risk of unlawful access to the data. This calls for rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. 54. With regard to the relationship between the controller and the processor it should not be permitted for the processors to have regard only to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they apply to personal data; this could endanger a sufficient high level of protection. 55. An act of law has to lay down substantive and procedural conditions and objective criteria by which to determine the limits of competent authorities\u2019 access to data and their subsequent use. For the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions, the offences concerned would have to be considered sufficiently serious to justify the extent and seriousness of these interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined for example in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. 56. The data has to be processed in a way that ensures the applicability and effect of the EU data protection rules; in particular those provided by Article 8 of the Charter, which states that the compliance with the requirements of protection and security shall be subject to control by an independent authority. The geographical place where the processing takes place may in such a situation be relevant. 57. With regard to the different steps of processing of personal data, a distinction should be made between the categories of data on the basis of their possible usefulness for the purposes of the objective pursued or according to the persons concerned. The determination of the conditions of the processing, for example, the determination of the retention period, must be based on objective criteria in order to ensure that the interference is limited to what is strictly necessary. 58. Based on each situation, the assessment of necessity and proportionality has to identify and consider all implications that fall within the scope of other fundamental rights, such as human dignity under Article 1 of the Charter, freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 10 of the Charter, freedom of expression under Article 11 of the Charter as well as freedom of assembly and association under Article 12 of the Charter. 59. Furthermore, it has to be considered as a matter of severity, that if the data is systematically processed without the knowledge of the data subjects, it is likely to generate a general conception of constant surveillance. This may lead to chilling effects in regard of some or all of the fundamental rights concerned ... 73.

    "answer": "The assessment of the disturbance actually caused by the assembly is all the more important in an ambiguous situation, such as gatherings not clearly falling under the domestic regulations. If there is doubt whether a particular event constitutes a form of assembly calling for notification or authorisation under the domestic law the authorities must adopt measures based on the degree of disturbance caused by the impugned conduct and not on formal grounds, such as non-compliance with the notification procedure. An interference with the freedom of an assembly involving its disruption, dispersal or the arrest of participants may only be justifiable on specific and averred substantive grounds, such as serious risks provided for by law (Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, \u00a7 136). The State has a positive obligation to protect the right to freedom of assembly of both demonstrating groups, and should find the least restrictive means that would, in principle, enable both demonstrations to take place (F\u00e1ber v. Hungary, 2012, \u00a7 43). The Court must be satisfied that in exercising the discretion afforded to the authorities by domestic law they acted in a manner compatible with the essence of the right to freedom of assembly, and, where relevant, with due recognition of the privileged protection under the Convention of political speech, debate on questions of public interest and the peaceful manifestation on such matters. A decision to disperse an assembly must be justified by relevant and sufficient reasons (Ibrahimov and Others v. Azerbaijan, 2016, \u00a7 80; Laguna Guzman v. Spain, 2020, \u00a7 51). The non-compliance of the assembly with the formal requirements for holding it is not sufficient for its dispersal (see Section F (2): Unlawful assembly). An interference with the freedom of an assembly involving its disruption, dispersal or the arrest of participants may only be justifiable on specific and averred substantive grounds, such as serious risks provided for by law (Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, \u00a7 137), and only after the participants had been given sufficient opportunity to manifest their views (\u00c9va Moln\u00e1r v. Hungary, 2008, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43).",

Turkey, no. 73333/01, \u00a7 51, 6 March 2007). In this respect, the instant case is different from others where the dispersal was quite prompt (see Bukta and Others, cited above, \u00a7 10; Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no.\u00a074552/01, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-42, ECHR 2006XIV; Bal\u00e7\u0131k and Others, cited above, \u00a7 51)."

They also noted that, together with other demonstrators, the applicant had not complied with the order to disperse. In those circumstances, and taking into account the margin of appreciation afforded to States in this sphere, the Government considered that the risk of disruption to civilians who were in the park at a busy time of day and the demonstrators\u2019 resistance justified the dispersal of the gathering in question. In their opinion, the police intervention had been a necessary measure within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 11 of the Convention."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 53: As regards the termination of the demonstration, it appears that the justification for that decision and the manner of its implementation were not subject to judicial assessment in the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts abstained from examining the wider context of the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 18 above) and her arguments about the unlawfulness of the order to disperse; likewise, they did not address her defence argument that it had been impossible to leave the venue of the assembly owing to the general commotion. It follows that no domestic balancing exercise was carried out, which would have allowed the Russian courts to weigh considerations of \u201cprevention of disorder\u201d or \u201cprotection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d against the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s situation was not substantially different from that of Mr Frumkin, and that the dispersal of the demonstration involving the applicant\u2019s arrest had a similar chilling effect, that is, of discouraging her and others from attending protest rallies. It concludes that the security measures implemented at the site of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, its early termination and the dispersal amounted to a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

        "answer": "Answer: The State's use of discretion in justifying disruption, dispersal, or arrest of participants in an assembly is bound by the Convention's stringent principles, and State authorities are under an obligation to consider the margin of appreciation and positive obligations to ensure the right to freedom of assembly is effectively applied.\nThe State must provide specific and averred substantive grounds that justify any interference with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, which should not exceed the permissible limitations.\n[/INST] Question: In the context of dispersing an assembly, how are the principles of Article 14 and Article 10 of the Convention applied in practice, and when does the interference with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly become disproportionate?\nAnswer: Article 14 of the Convention provides authorities with powers and duties in connection with the holding of an assembly, while Article 10 establishes the limitations on public speech, debate, and the expression of opinions.\nThe application of these principles in practice requires a delicate balance between the interests of individuals and public order.\nWhen the authorities issue orders to disperse and arrest participants who fail to comply, these actions are justified if they are based on specific and averred substantive grounds, such as serious risks.\nThe disruption, dispersal, or arrest of participants can become disproportionate if the consequences of the interference do not justify the measures taken by the authorities, or if the authorities fail to consider the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in their actions.\n[/INST] Question: Did the domestic courts strike the right balance between the interests of the applicants and the public order in the cases under discussion?\nAnswer: The Court observes that the domestic courts did not strike a fair balance between the interests of the applicants and the public order in the three cases under discussion.\nThe courts failed to consider the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in their actions, and failed to conduct a balancing assessment between the interests of the applicants in exercising their right to freedom of peaceful assembly, and those of the authorities in ensuring public order.\nThe interferences in the form of prosecution for failing to comply with orders to disperse were not justified with reference to specific and averred substantive grounds.\nThis failure to strike the right balance led to unjustified infringements on the applicants' rights.\n[/INST] Question: What is the Court's assessment of the police's use of force in dispersing crowds and arresting participants for failing to comply with orders to disperse in the cases discussed?\nAnswer: The Court held that the police's use of force in dispersing crowds and arresting participants must be based on specific and averred substantive grounds.\nIn the three cases under discussion, the police did not clearly justify their actions with such grounds.\nThe Court further noted that the police should have considered the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in their actions to respect the essence of the right to freedom of assembly, and the privileged protection under the Convention of political speech, debate on questions of public interest, and the peaceful expression of opinions.\n[/INST] Question: In what circumstances is an immediate response to a current political event by way of a demonstration considered a necessary infringement on the right to hold spontaneous demonstrations?\nAnswer: An immediate response to a current political event by way of a demonstration may be considered a necessary infringement on the right to hold spontaneous demonstrations if it warrants a demonstration in the form of a spontaneous peaceful assembly.\nThe right to hold spontaneous demonstrations may override the obligation to give prior notification to public assemblies when there is an immediate response to a current political event.\nThis means that in some circumstances, the freedom of assembly can be prioritised over the requirement to give prior notice, allowing for a more responsive approach to political events.\n[/INST] Question: According to the K\u00faria's report, how did the police handle the demonstration in the three cases under discussion?\nDid they strike a fair balance between the right to freedom of assembly and the potential disruption caused by the impugned conduct?\nAnswer: According to the K\u00faria's report on the three cases under discussion, the police handled the demonstration by issuing orders to disperse.\nHowever, the Court found that the courts did not strike a fair balance between the right to freedom of assembly and the potential disruption caused by the impugned conduct.\nThe courts failed to consider the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in their actions and failed to conduct a balancing assessment between the interests of the applicants and the authorities.",

In its judgments of 23 September 2015 and 6 January 2016 the K\u00faria reiterated that under the Freedom of Assembly Act no. III of 1989 the dispersal of demonstrations was a possibility rather than an obligation for the police and restrictions on the fundamental rights of others did not in themselves justify the restriction of the right of assembly. Furthermore, dispersal could only be used as a last resort, if the demonstration was likely to entail serious consequences. Relying on the report by the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, the K\u00faria considered that despite certain violent actions, the demonstration had on the whole remained peaceful. The court went on to find that the police had been under an obligation to respect the principle of proportionality and had been right to conclude that dispersing the march could have caused more serious prejudice to the Roma community than allowing the demonstration to continue in a controlled manner."

The domestic courts abstained from examining the wider context of the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 18 above) and her arguments about the unlawfulness of the order to disperse; likewise, they did not address her defence argument that it had been impossible to leave the venue of the assembly owing to the general commotion.

Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s situation was not substantially different from that of Mr Frumkin, and that the dispersal of the demonstration involving the applicant\u2019s arrest had a similar chilling effect, that is, of discouraging her and others from attending protest rallies. It concludes that the security measures implemented at the site of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, its early termination and the dispersal amounted to a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 375: The applicants further argued that under Russian law, if a public event was held at a location, time or in a manner not approved by the authorities that event could be dispersed by the police and its organisers and the participants brought to liability for an administrative offence of a breach of the established procedure for the conduct of public events. Under Russian law the recourse to forced dispersal was not limited to cases of violent assemblies or assemblies presenting danger to public order or public safety; the mere fact of unlawfulness of a public event was sufficient to legitimise its dispersal under the domestic law. The Court had however already found that the fact that the assembly was unlawful did not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no.\u00a074552/01, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2006XIII). It was important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention was not to be deprived of its substance (see Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, \u00a7 136, 30\u00a0May 2013). In the applicants\u2019 opinion, the mere failure to comply with the restrictions on the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event imposed by the authorities did not justify its dispersal. Such dispersal could be justified only when it was applied as a measure of last resort where there was an imminent threat of violence and where other reasonable measures to facilitate and protect the assembly from harm (for example, by quieting violent individuals) had proved ineffective (they referred to \u00a7\u00a7 165 and 166 of the OSCE/ODIHR Guidelines, cited in paragraph 317 above). A blanket use of dispersals for non-violent assemblies by the Russian authorities might not be considered \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d."

The domestic courts abstained from examining the wider context of the applicant\u2019s arrest (see paragraph 18 above) and her arguments about the unlawfulness of the order to disperse; likewise, they did not address her defence argument that it had been impossible to leave the venue of the assembly owing to the general commotion.

Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s situation was not substantially different from that of Mr Frumkin, and that the dispersal of the demonstration involving the applicant\u2019s arrest had a similar chilling effect, that is, of discouraging her and others from attending protest rallies. It concludes that the security measures implemented at the site of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, its early termination and the dispersal amounted to a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

Examining the domestic approach to dispersal of demonstrations, it appears that the police have a similar obligation to disband an assembly if the exercise of the right of assembly constitutes a criminal offence or a call to commit such an offence, or if it violates the rights and freedoms of others, as demonstrated by the judgment of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 35 above)."

    "question": "How does the Court determine whether a State has fulfilled its positive obligation to issue travel documents and ensure the right to enter under Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4, considering the diverse situations in the Contracting States and the State's margin of appreciation in choosing practical measures?",
    "answer": "As regards the implementation of the right to enter guaranteed by Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4, and as in other contexts, the scope of any positive obligations will inevitably vary, depending on the diverse situations in the Contracting States and the choices to be made in terms of priorities and resources. Those obligations must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. As to the choice of particular practical measures, where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State\u2019s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues for securing Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided for by domestic law, it may still have fulfilled its positive obligation by other means (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 252). Some positive obligations correspond to measures which stem traditionally from the State\u2019s obligation to issue travel documents to nationals, to ensure that they can cross the border (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 251 and 260). In some cases, nationals can be deprived of the right to enter for the reason that the respondent State did not carry out the formalities required by domestic law and international rules to guarantee their entry or because it failed to issue the requisite travel documents to allow them to cross the border and to ensure they could return (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 207). However, any such requirement must be interpreted narrowly and will be binding on States only in exceptional circumstances, for example where extraterritorial factors directly threaten the life and physical well-being of a child in a situation of extreme vulnerability. In addition, when examining whether a State has failed to fulfil its positive obligation to guarantee the effective exercise of the right to enter its territory, under Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4, where such exceptional circumstances exist, the requisite review will be confined to ensuring effective protection against arbitrariness in the State\u2019s discharge of its positive obligation under that provision (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 261). The Court is aware of the varying approaches adopted by States, which seek to reconcile the imperatives of their governmental policies and respect for their legal obligations under national or international law. However, the Court must ascertain that the exercise by the State of its discretionary power is compatible with the fundamental principles of the rule of law and prohibition of arbitrariness, principles which underlie the Convention as a whole (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 262).",

This is not a case where those concerned have been deprived of the right to enter for the reason that the respondent State did not carry out the formalities required by domestic law and international rules to guarantee their entry, or because it failed to issue the requisite travel documents to allow them to cross the border and to ensure they could return (compare, for example, Marangos v. Cyprus, no.\u00a031106/96, Commission decision of 20 May 1997, unreported, and Mom\u010dilovi\u0107 v. Croatia (dec.), no.\u00a059138/00, 29 August 2002). Such a decision does not therefore fall within the exercise by the State of its ordinary public powers in policing the border, a circumstance which would suffice to bring the applicants\u2019 family members \u2013 French nationals \u2013 within the territorial jurisdiction of France, which begins at the line forming the border (see N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], nos.\u00a08675/15 and 8697/15, \u00a7 109, 13\u00a0February 2020). The Court refers here in particular to the position of the Government which, in their written observations on the complaint under Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4 and at the hearing, indicated that if the applicants\u2019 daughters and grandchildren were to arrive at the border they would not be turned away and would be allowed to enter France (see paragraph 218 below).",

These correspond to measures which stem traditionally from the State\u2019s obligation to issue travel documents to nationals, to ensure that they can cross the border (see, for example, Marangos, and Mom\u010dilovi\u0107, both cited above).",

Romania [GC], no. 80982/12, \u00a7\u00a0122, 15\u00a0October 2020, and the cases cited in paragraph 208 above). Furthermore, the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed may, in certain circumstances, require the State to take operational measures (see, among many other authorities, Kurt v.\u00a0Austria [GC], no. 62903/15, \u00a7\u00a7 157 et seq., 15\u00a0June 2021). Without calling into question the \u201cabsolute\u201d nature of the right to enter guaranteed by Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04, which contains no express restrictions, the Court would again emphasise that, as regards the implementation of this right, and as in other contexts, the scope of any positive obligations will inevitably vary, depending on the diverse situations in the Contracting States and the choices to be made in terms of priorities and resources. Those obligations must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no. 32772/02, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2009; Kurt, cited above, \u00a7 158; and X and Others v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 182).

One example is the obligation to issue them with travel documents to enable them to cross a border. The Court further points out that, as can be seen from the preparatory work on Protocol No. 4, the object of the right to enter the territory of a State of which one is a national is to prohibit the exile of nationals, a measure of banishment that has, at certain times in history, been enforced against specific categories of individuals (see paragraph\u00a0126 above). Seen from this perspective, it considers that Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04 may impose a positive obligation on the State where, in view of the specificities of a given case, a refusal by that State to take any action would leave the national concerned in a situation comparable, de facto, to that of exile.",

In addition, when examining whether a State has failed to fulfil its positive obligation to guarantee the effective exercise of the right to enter its territory, under Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No.\u00a04, where such exceptional circumstances exist, the requisite review will be confined to ensuring effective protection against arbitrariness in the State\u2019s discharge of its positive obligation under that provision.",

RUSSIA; \u00a7 84: Having regard to the absolute character of the protection guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention and given its fundamental importance in the Convention system, the Court has developed a test for cases concerning a State\u2019s positive obligation under that Convention provision. In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The test does not, however, require it to be shown that \u201cbut for\u201d the failing or omission of the public authority the ill-treatment would not have occurred. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Pantea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-96). The Court also reiterates that State responsibility is engaged by a failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm to the applicant (see E. and Others v. the , no. 33218/96, \u00a7\u00a7 89-101, 26 November 2002). The Court therefore has to establish whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities knew or ought to have known that the first applicant was suffering or at risk of being subjected to ill-treatment at the hands of his cellmates, and if so, whether the administration of the detention facility, within the limits of their official powers, took reasonable steps to eliminate those risks and to protect the first applicant from that abuse."

Romania, no. 80982/12, \u00a7\u00a0122, 15\u00a0October 2020, and the cases cited in paragraph 208 above). Furthermore, the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed may, in certain circumstances, require the State to take operational measures (see, among many other authorities, Kurt v.\u00a0Austria, no. 62903/15, \u00a7\u00a7 157 et seq., 15\u00a0June 2021). Without calling into question the \u201cabsolute\u201d nature of the right to enter guaranteed by Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04, which contains no express restrictions, the Court would again emphasise that, as regards the implementation of this right, and as in other contexts, the scope of any positive obligations will inevitably vary, depending on the diverse situations in the Contracting States and the choices to be made in terms of priorities and resources. Those obligations must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2), no. 32772/02, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2009; Kurt, cited above, \u00a7 158; and X and Others v. Bulgaria, cited above, \u00a7 182). As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State\u2019s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues for securing Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided for by domestic law, it may still have fulfilled its positive obligation by other means (see Budayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 15339/02 and 4 others, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0134 and\u00a0135, ECHR 2008, and Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v.\u00a0Portugal, no.\u00a056080/13, \u00a7\u00a0216, 19 December 2017)."

FRANCE; \u00a7 260: Even though Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not guarantee a general right to repatriation for the benefit of nationals of a State who are outside its borders (see paragraphs 255-259 above), the Court would refer to its earlier acknowledgment that this provision may impose on a State certain positive obligations vis-\u00e0-vis its nationals in order to ensure that their right to enter national territory is practical and effective (see paragraphs 251 and 252 above). One example is the obligation to issue them with travel documents to enable them to cross a border. The Court further points out that, as can be seen from the preparatory work on Protocol No. 4, the object of the right to enter the territory of a State of which one is a national is to prohibit the exile of nationals, a measure of banishment that has, at certain times in history, been enforced against specific categories of individuals (see paragraph\u00a0126 above). Seen from this perspective, it considers that Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04 may impose a positive obligation on the State where, in view of the specificities of a given case, a refusal by that State to take any action would leave the national concerned in a situation comparable, de facto, to that of exile."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 84: Having regard to the absolute character of the protection guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention and given its fundamental importance in the Convention system, the Court has developed a test for cases concerning a State\u2019s positive obligation under that Convention provision. In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The test does not, however, require it to be shown that \u201cbut for\u201d the failing or omission of the public authority the ill-treatment would not have occurred. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Pantea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-96). The Court also reiterates that State responsibility is engaged by a failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm to the applicant (see E. and Others v. the , no. 33218/96, \u00a7\u00a7 89-101, 26 November 2002). The Court therefore has to establish whether, in the circumstances of the present case, the authorities knew or ought to have known that the first applicant was suffering or at risk of being subjected to ill-treatment at the hands of his cellmates, and if so, whether the administration of the detention facility, within the limits of their official powers, took reasonable steps to eliminate those risks and to protect the first applicant from that abuse."

    "question": "How does the Court differentiate between applicants and victims in cases involving derogation from Convention obligations under Article 15, and what criteria does the Court consider in determining whether the conditions for derogation are met based on the specific facts of the case?",
    "answer": "It is for the Court to determine the significance to be attached to those circumstances and to ascertain whether the balance struck complied with the applicable provisions of the relevant article, in the light of their particular wording and the article\u2019s overall object and purpose (Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1988, \u00a7 48, in respect of Article 5). For this reason, in any case where an applicant complains that his or her Convention rights were violated during a period of derogation, the Court will first examine whether the measures taken can be justified under the substantive articles of the Convention; it is only if it cannot be so justified that the Court will go on to determine whether the derogation was valid (see, for instance, A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2009, \u00a7 161; Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 1978, \u00a7 191; Lawless v. Ireland (no. 3), 1961, \u00a7 15). This does not, however, preclude proper account being taken of the background circumstances of the case.",

This it does by giving judgments and decisions interpreting the provisions of the Convention in specific cases on the basis of applications submitted under Articles 33 and 34 of the Convention by High Contracting Parties and persons, non-governmental organisations or groups of individuals claiming to be victims of violations of their rights, respectively, and by giving advisory opinions on questions within its competence under Article 47 of the Convention at the request of the Committee of Ministers (see, in particular, Salah v. the Netherlands, no. 8196/02, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2006IX (extracts); see also Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, \u00a7 70, Series A no. 310)."

The Court notes that the provisions of the Convention are to be interpreted in a manner which renders its safeguards practical and effective.

    "answer": "This positive obligation to protect is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources. Accordingly, not every risk of ill-treatment could entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take measures to prevent that risk from materialising. However, the required measures should, at least, provide effective protection in particular of children and other vulnerable persons and should include reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (O\u2019Keeffe v. Ireland [GC], 2014, \u00a7 144). The Court observes that in this context, the assessment of the nature and level of risk constitutes an integral part of the duty to take preventive operational measures where the presence of a risk so requires. Thus, an examination of the State\u2019s compliance with this duty must comprise an analysis of both the adequacy of the assessment of risk conducted by the domestic authorities and, where a relevant risk triggering the duty to act was or ought to have been identified, the adequacy of the preventive measures taken (Kurt v. Austria [GC], 2021, \u00a7 159, albeit under Article 2 of the Convention). The Court has also underlined that it is not necessary to show that \u201cbut for\u201d the State omission the ill-treatment would not have happened. A failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm is sufficient to engage the responsibility of the State (O\u2019Keeffe v. Ireland [GC], 2014, \u00a7 149).",

It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The obligation on High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals. This positive obligation to protect is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources.

The Court emphasizes that the State has an ongoing duty to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of children in their care, and in cases where such individuals are in a particularly vulnerable situation, the obligation imposed on the authorities to take preventive operational measures is heightened, requiring them to exercise particular vigilance ([Doc 2]).\n    2. The duty to take preventive operational measures under Article 2 is an obligation of means, not of result, and the failure to achieve the desired result in itself may not justify a finding of a violation of the State's preventive operational obligation under Article 2.\nHowever, the assessment of the nature and level of risk constitutes an integral part of this duty ([Doc 1]).\n    3. The Court recognizes that it is impossible to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities, given the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct, and the operational choices required by the authorities to prioritize resources ([Doc 9, Doc 8]).\n    4. The Court refers to cases such as Osman, L.C.B., Keenan, and Renolde v. France to support its position that not every claimed risk to life warrants the State's obligation to take preventive operational measures ([Doc 1, Doc 4, Doc 3, Doc 8]).\n5.\nThe Court applies the Osman test, which requires that the State knew or ought to have known of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party.\nIf the State fails to take measures within the scope of their powers, which could have been reasonably expected to avoid that risk, a violation of the duty under Article 2 may be established ([Doc 9]).\n6.\nThe Court emphasizes that the scope of the positive obligation is determined by the risks posed in a particular case, and a failure to act does not necessarily entail a violation of Article 2.\nHowever, if the State had knowledge of a risk, it must be established whether they took all steps that could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent that risk from materialising (L.C.B., cited above, \u00a7\u00a038, para 9).\n    7. The assessment of the adequacy of the State's measures includes examining both the adequacy of the assessment of risk conducted by domestic authorities and their compliance with their duty under Article 2 by considering the preventive measures taken ([Doc 8]).\n    8. The Court stresses the importance of a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for prevention, suppression, and punishment of breaches ([Doc 3]).\n9.\nThe Court acknowledges that a real-life danger has been identified, and no-action from the authorities would render the risk foreseeable and the omission of preventive measures in the context of special diligence a violation of their positive obligation under the Osman test.\nHowever, in cases where the risk assessed by authorities is not followed by a standardised risk assessment procedure, it must be found that the assessment fulfilled the requirements of being autonomous, proactive, and comprehensive ([Doc 5]).\n    10. The Supreme Court's decision to issue a barring and protection order is also validated, as it shows that the risks identified were serious enough to warrant such measures ([Doc 6]).\nThese principles and considerations guide the Court when assessing the adequacy of State's preventive operational measures and risk assessments in fulfilling its duty to protect individuals from ill-treatment.",

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions.

The risk did not need to come to pass in order for that positive obligation to be imposed on the State.

In these circumstances the Court considers that the obligation imposed on the authorities by Article 3 of the Convention to take preventive operational measures where they have, or ought to have, knowledge of a risk that a child may be subjected to illtreatment, was heightened in the present case and required the authorities in question to exercise particular vigilance. It must therefore ascertain whether, in the particular case, the authorities of the respondent State knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the applicants of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 and, if so, whether they took all the measures that could reasonably be expected of them to avoid that risk (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, \u00a7 116)."

In particular, it has held that to successfully argue a violation of his Article 3 right it would be sufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that the authorities had not taken all steps which could have been reasonably expected of them to prevent real and immediate risks to the applicant\u2019s physical integrity, of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge. The test does not, however, require it to be shown that \u201cbut for\u201d the failing or omission of the public authority the ill-treatment would not have occurred. The answer to the question whether the authorities fulfilled their positive obligation under Article 3 will depend on all the circumstances of the case under examination (see Pantea, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 191-96). The Court also reiterates that State responsibility is engaged by a failure to take reasonably available measures which could have had a real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm to the applicant (see E. and Others v. the , no. 33218/96, \u00a7\u00a7 89-101, 26 November 2002).

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual from another individual or, in particular circumstances, from himself (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 115, Reports 1998VIII; Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2001-III; and Renolde v.

    "answer": "The applicant had been completely dependent on the authorities\u2019 diligence in implementing the highly flexible safeguards laid down in the applicable code of practice, in ensuring the proportionality of the data retention period. The lack of safeguards to facilitate the deletion of the data as soon as the period of retention became disproportionate is particularly disturbing where data revealing political opinions, which attracts a heightened level of protection, is being retained indefinitely (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 122-123). The lack of effective safeguards on deletion of personal data which are no longer relevant in terms of the purpose of their storage is particularly worrying in the case of special categories of sensitive data attracting a heightened level of protection (Catt v. the United Kingdom, 2019, \u00a7 112). In the absence of any regulations on the maximum period of storage of such data, the applicant was left entirely dependent on the diligence with which the authorities would apply the guarantees set out in the applicable code of practice, which were very flexible, in order to ensure the proportionality of the period of retention of his data.",

          "112": "112.\u00a0\u00a0However, the Court considers in the present case there are reasons for doing so. In the first place it considers significant that personal data revealing political opinion falls among the special categories of sensitive data attracting a heightened level of protection (see paragraphs 58-60 and\u00a067-70 above and S. and Marper, cited above, \u00a7 76). It notes that at the domestic level this element of the complaint was characterised as one of data protection law and was not a particular focus of the litigation. Having concluded that retention of the applicant\u2019s data was not justified under Article 8, the Court of Appeal did not consider that examining the specific principles of data protection would add anything to their analysis (see \u00a7 65). The applicant did not pursue specific data protection arguments before the Supreme Court, which therefore only referred to data protection law generally in the context of lawfulness. However, the Court considers that the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint meant that the sensitive nature of the data in question was a central feature of the case both before the domestic courts as well as before this Court (see paragraph 80 above).",
          "122": "122.\u00a0\u00a0Also, whilst the applicant could and did request the disclosure and destruction of his data, this safeguard appears to have been of limited impact given the refusal to delete his data or to provide any explanation for its continued retention \u2013 including the later disclosure without explanation of the retention of additional data (see paragraphs 11 and 15-17 above). So far as the Court is aware, at least some of the applicant\u2019s personal data concerning his involvement in non-violent protest was collected over six years ago and remains in the domestic extremism database (see paragraph\u00a016, above) despite the fact that the police concluded, and the domestic courts affirmed that the applicant was not considered a danger to anyone (see paragraph\u00a031, above).",
          "123": "123.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the absence of effective safeguards was of particular concern in the present case, as personal data revealing political opinions attracts a heightened level of protection (see paragraph 112 above). Engaging in peaceful protest has specific protection under Article 11 of the Convention, which also contains special protection for trade unions, whose events the applicant attended (see paragraph 10, above). In this connection it notes that in the National Coordinator\u2019s statement, the definition of \u201cdomestic extremism\u201d refers to collection of data on groups and individuals who act \u201coutside the democratic process\u201d. Therefore, the police do not appear to have respected their own definition (fluid as it may have been (see paragraph 105)) in retaining data on the applicant\u2019s association with peaceful, political events: such events are a vital part of the democratic process (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, \u00a7\u00a092, ECHR 2004I). The Court has already highlighted the danger of an ambiguous approach to the scope of data collection in the present case (see paragraph\u00a097 above). Accordingly, it considers that the decisions to retain the applicant\u2019s personal data did not take into account the heightened level of protection it attracted as data revealing a political opinion, and that in the circumstances its retention must have had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d."

        "answer": "I. Introduction\n\nI am an expert in European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) law. The question at hand concerns the limitations of the guarantees set out in a code of practice regarding the retention of sensitive data relating to a peaceful demonstrator's political opinions. Herein, I will discuss the applicable data protection law, the guarantees set out in the code of practice, and how these guarantees affect the proportionality of the data retention period.\n\nII. Applicable Data Protection Law\n\nTo answer this question, we must first understand the relevant data protection law. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) protects the right to private and family life, which includes the protection of personal data. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets out the rules for the collection, processing, and retention of personal data.\n\nIII. Guarantees Set Out in the Code of Practice\n\nA code of practice for law enforcement agencies, such as those handling sensitive data from peaceful demonstrators, may include various guarantees intended to protect individuals' privacy and human rights while ensuring effective law enforcement. Some of these guarantees may include (but are not limited to):\n\n1. Data security: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data through appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or destruction of the data.\n2. Purpose limitation: Collecting and retaining data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and not processing the data beyond these purposes without proper authorization.\n3. Transparency: Clearly informing individuals about the collection, processing, and retention of their personal data, the legal basis for such actions, and their rights regarding access, rectification, erasure, and objection.\n4. Minimization: Collecting and retaining only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the intended purpose.\n5. Proportionality: Ensuring that the period of retention of personal data is proportionate to the purpose and does not go beyond what is necessary.\n\nIV. Limitations of Guarantees and Effect on Proportionality\n\nThe effectiveness of the guarantees in the code of practice can affect the proportionality of the period of retention of sensitive data in several ways:\n\n1. Data security: Inadequate data security measures could lead to breaches, potentially exposing individuals' sensitive data, including political opinions, to unauthorized third parties. This could potentially prolong the unjustified retention of such data.\n2. Purpose limitation: If law enforcement agencies collect and retain data for purposes other than those stated in the code of practice, or fail to delete or anonymize the data when the original purpose has been fulfilled, it could lead to extended retention periods and potential infringement of individuals' privacy rights.\n3. Transparency: Insufficient transparency regarding the collection, processing, and retention of personal data, or failure to effectively communicate individuals' rights, could lead to extended retention periods as individuals may be unaware of how long their data is being retained.\n4. Minimization: Collecting and retaining excessive amounts of personal data, beyond what is necessary to achieve the intended purpose, could similarly lead to extended retention periods and potential privacy infringement.\n5. Proportionality: The code of practice's guarantee to ensure a proportionate retention period can be challenged if an individual's data is retained for an unreasonably long time; however, the effectiveness of this guarantee depends on the other guarantees being adequately implemented.\n\nIn summary, the limitations of the guarantees in a code of practice can weaken the overall protections for individuals' privacy rights, particularly regarding the retention of sensitive data relating to peaceful demonstrators' political opinions. Consequently, it is crucial that law enforcement agencies comply with these guarantees to maintain the proportionality of the data retention period and respect individuals' right to private and family life.",

The need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should, in particular, ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored, and preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored. The domestic law should also comprise safeguards capable of effectively protecting the personal data recorded against inappropriate and wrongful use (see B.B., cited above, \u00a7 61), while providing a practical means of lodging a request for the deletion of the data stored (see B.B., cited above, \u00a7 68, and Brunet, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a041-43)."

In the Court's view, safeguards should be in place in order to avoid any possible abuse in such circumstances and to ensure the effective protection of a person's rights under Article 8 of the Convention. Such safeguards might include the adoption of regulatory measures which both confine the use of special forces to situations where ordinary police intervention cannot be regarded as safe and sufficient and, in addition, prescribe procedural guarantees ensuring, for example, the presence of an impartial person during the operation or the obtaining of the owner's clear, written consent as a pre-condition to entering his or her premises.

These principles were supplemented by a statutory Code of Practice and administrative Guidance (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d, below), compliance with which was mandatory.

        "answer": "I. Introduction\n\nI am an expert in European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) law. The question at hand concerns the limitations of the guarantees set out in a code of practice regarding the retention of sensitive data relating to a peaceful demonstrator's political opinions. Herein, I will discuss the applicable data protection law, the guarantees set out in the code of practice, and how these guarantees affect the proportionality of the data retention period.\n\nII. Applicable Data Protection Law\n\nTo answer this question, we must first understand the relevant data protection law. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) protects the right to private and family life, which includes the protection of personal data. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets out the rules for the collection, processing, and retention of personal data.\n\nIII. Guarantees Set Out in the Code of Practice\n\nA code of practice for law enforcement agencies, such as those handling sensitive data from peaceful demonstrators, may include various guarantees intended to protect individuals' privacy and human rights while ensuring effective law enforcement. Some of these guarantees may include (but are not limited to):\n\n1. Data security: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data through appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or destruction of the data.\n2. Purpose limitation: Collecting and retaining data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and not processing the data beyond these purposes without proper authorization.\n3. Transparency: Clearly informing individuals about the collection, processing, and retention of their personal data, the legal basis for such actions, and their rights regarding access, rectification, erasure, and objection.\n4. Minimization: Collecting and retaining only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the intended purpose.\n5. Proportionality: Ensuring that the period of retention of personal data is proportionate to the purpose and does not go beyond what is necessary.\n\nIV. Limitations of Guarantees and Effect on Proportionality\n\nThe effectiveness of the guarantees in the code of practice can affect the proportionality of the period of retention of sensitive data in several ways:\n\n1. Data security: Inadequate data security measures could lead to breaches, potentially exposing individuals' sensitive data, including political opinions, to unauthorized third parties. This could potentially prolong the unjustified retention of such data.\n2. Purpose limitation: If law enforcement agencies collect and retain data for purposes other than those stated in the code of practice, or fail to delete or anonymize the data when the original purpose has been fulfilled, it could lead to extended retention periods and potential infringement of individuals' privacy rights.\n3. Transparency: Insufficient transparency regarding the collection, processing, and retention of personal data, or failure to effectively communicate individuals' rights, could lead to extended retention periods as individuals may be unaware of how long their data is being retained.\n4. Minimization: Collecting and retaining excessive amounts of personal data, beyond what is necessary to achieve the intended purpose, could similarly lead to extended retention periods and potential privacy infringement.\n5. Proportionality: The code of practice's guarantee to ensure a proportionate retention period can be challenged if an individual's data is retained for an unreasonably long time; however, the effectiveness of this guarantee depends on the other guarantees being adequately implemented.\n\nIn summary, the limitations of the guarantees in a code of practice can weaken the overall protections for individuals' privacy rights, particularly regarding the retention of sensitive data relating to peaceful demonstrators' political opinions. Consequently, it is crucial that law enforcement agencies comply with these guarantees to maintain the proportionality of the data retention period and respect individuals' right to private and family life.",

Their retention was neither warranted by any degree of suspicion of the applicants\u2019 involvement in a crime or propensity to crime nor directed at retaining records in respect of investigated alleged offences in the past. The records were retained because the police had already been lawfully in possession of them, and their retention would assist in the future prevention and detection of crime in general by increasing the size of the database. Retention resulted in no stigma and produced no practical consequence for the applicants unless the records matched a crime-scene profile.

The Court observes that the protection afforded by Article 8 of the Convention would be unacceptably weakened if the use of modern scientific techniques in the criminal-justice system were allowed at any cost and without carefully balancing the potential benefits of the extensive use of such techniques against important private-life interests. In the Court\u2019s view, the strong consensus existing among the Contracting States in this respect is of considerable importance and narrows the margin of appreciation left to the respondent State in the assessment of the permissible limits of the interference with private life in this sphere. The Court considers that any State claiming a pioneer role in the development of new technologies bears special responsibility for striking the right balance in this regard."

In Privacy International the CJEU found that national legislation enabling a State authority to require providers of electronic communications services to forward traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies for the purpose of safeguarding national security fell within the scope of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications. The interpretation of that Directive had to take account of the right to privacy, guaranteed by Article 7 of the Charter, the right to protection of personal data, guaranteed by Article 8, and the right to freedom of expression, guaranteed by Article\u00a011. Limitations on the exercise of those rights had to be provided for by law, respect the essence of the rights, and be proportionate, necessary, and genuinely meet the objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others. Furthermore, limitations on the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary; and in order to satisfy the requirement of proportionality, the legislation must lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data are affected have sufficient guarantees that data will be protected effectively against the risk of abuse."

The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such use of personal data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees of this Article (see S. and Marper, cited above, \u00a7 103, and Gardel, B.B. and M.B., cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 62, 61 and 53 respectively). In line with its findings in S. and Marper (cited above), the Court is of the opinion that the need for such safeguards is all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned, not least when such data are used for police purposes. The domestic law should notably ensure that such data are relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored, and preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored. The domestic law must also afford adequate guarantees that retained personal data were efficiently protected from misuse and abuse (ibid.)."

    "question": "How does the Court determine whether the temporary placement of children in a separate class based on language proficiency is contrary to Article 14 of the Convention, and what safeguards need to be put in place when such a measure disproportionately or exclusively affects members of a specific ethnic group?",
    "answer": "Finally, the aims indicated by the Governments to justify differential treatment may be considered legitimate only if certain safeguards are put in place, and it is the Court\u2019s task to examine whether such safeguards exist at each stage of the implementation of the measures and whether they are effective. For example, the temporary placement of children in a separate class on the ground that they lacked adequate command of the language of instruction in school is not, as such, automatically contrary to Article 14 of the Convention. Indeed, in certain circumstances such placement may pursue the legitimate aim of adapting the education system to the specific needs of the children. However, when such a measure disproportionately or even exclusively affects members of a specific ethnic group, then appropriate safeguards have to be put in place (Or\u0161u\u0161 and Others v. Croatia [GC], 2010, \u00a7 157). After establishing a legitimate aim, the Court requires that the difference in treatment strike a fair balance between the protection of the interests of the community and respect for the rights and freedoms of the individual (the Belgian linguistic case, 1968, \u00a7 10 of \u201cthe Law\u201d part). Thus, the Court requires a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (Molla Sali v. Greece [GC], 2018, \u00a7 135; Fabris v. France [GC], 2013, \u00a7 56; Mazurek v. France, 2000, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 48; Larkos v. Cyprus [GC], 1999, \u00a7 29). However, the fact that the measure of placing children in separate classes on the basis of their insufficient language skills had only applied to Roma students gave rise to a presumption of differential treatment.",

In Croatia, primary education consists of eight grades and children are obliged to attend school from the age of seven to fifteen. The first four grades are considered as lower grades and each class is assigned a class teacher who in principle teaches all subjects. The fifth to eighth grades are upper grades in which, in addition to a class teacher assigned to each class, different teachers teach different subjects.

However, when such a measure disproportionately or even, as in the present case, exclusively, affects members of a specific ethnic group, then appropriate safeguards have to be put in place (see Buckley v. the United Kingdom , 25 September 1996, \u00a7 76, Reports 1996 \u2011 IV; Connors , cited above, \u00a7 83; and Timishev , cited above, \u00a7 56).

When assessing whether the temporary placement of children in separate classes based on language proficiency constitutes discrimination under Article 14, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) will consider several factors.\n\nFirst, the ECtHR will determine whether there is a difference in treatment between members of different linguistic or ethnic groups.

ITALY; \u00a7 81: According to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in treatment of persons in relevantly similar situations (see H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0108), or an issue will arise when States fail to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different (see Thlimmenos, cited above, \u00a7\u00a044 in fine). On the latter point the Court reiterates that Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between them; indeed in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the Article (see Case \u201crelating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\u201d (merits), 23 July 1968, \u00a7 10, Series A no. 6; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2006VI; and Mu\u0148oz Diaz v.\u00a0Spain, no.\u00a049151/07, \u00a7\u00a048, ECHR 2009). Furthermore, the Court has already accepted in previous cases that where a general policy or measure has disproportionately prejudicial effects on a particular group, it is not excluded that this may be considered as discriminatory notwithstanding that it is not specifically aimed or directed at that group and there is no discriminatory intent. Such a situation may amount to \u201cindirect\u00a0discrimination\u201d.

On 3 November 2003 the applicants\u2019 lawyer lodged an application with the Constitutional Court to expedite the proceedings. On 7 February 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaint in its decision no. U-III-3138/2002, published in Official Gazette no. 22 of 26 February 2007. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows. \u201cThe first-instance court established in the impugned judgment that the criteria for formation of classes in the defendant primary schools had been knowledge of the Croatian language and not the pupils\u2019 ethnic origin. The court considered that the complainants had failed to prove their assertion that they had been placed in their classes on the basis of their racial and ethnic origin. The court stressed that the complainants relied exclusively on the activity report of the Ombudsman for the year 2000. However, the Ombudsman said in his evidence that the part of the report referring to the education of Roma had been injudicious because all the relevant facts had not been established. The first-instance court relied on section 27 paragraph 1 of the Primary Education Act ... which provides that teaching in primary schools is in the Croatian language and Latin script, and considered a lack of knowledge of the Croatian language as an objective impediment in complying with the requirements of the school curriculum, which also transpires from the conclusion of a study carried out for the needs of the Croatian Helsinki Committee. The court found: \u2018pupils enrolling in the first year of primary schools have to know the Croatian language, so that they are able to follow the teaching, if the purpose of primary education is to be fulfilled. It is therefore logical that classes with children who do not know the Croatian language require additional efforts and commitment of teachers, in particular to teach them the Croatian language.\u2019 The first-instance court found that the defendants had not acted against the law in that they had not changed the composition of classes once established, as only in exceptional situations was the transfer of pupils from one class to another allowed. The court considered that this practice respected the integrity of a class and its unity in the upper grades. The court considered that classes should be formed so as to create favourable conditions for an equal approach to all pupils according to the prescribed curriculum and programme, which could be achieved only where a class consisted of a permanent group of pupils of approximately the same age and knowledge. Furthermore, the court found that the complainants had failed to prove their assertion that ... they had a curriculum of significantly smaller volume than the one prescribed for primary schools by the Ministry of Education and Sports on 16 June 1999. The court found that the above assertion of the complainants relied on the Ombudsman\u2019s report. However, the Ombudsman said in his testimony that he did not know how the fact that in Roma-only classes the teaching followed a so-called special programme had been established. The court established that teaching in the complainants\u2019 respective classes and the parallel ones followed the same curriculum. Only in the Kur\u0161anec Primary School were there some deviations from the school curriculum, but the court found those deviations permissible since they had occurred ... at the beginning of the school year owing to low attendance. After having established that the complainants had not been placed in their classes according to their racial and ethnic origin and that the curriculum had been the same in all parallel classes, the first-instance court dismissed the complainants\u2019 action. ... The reasoning of the first-instance judgment ... shows that the defendant primary schools replied to the complainants\u2019 allegations as follows: \u2018The enrolled in the first year those children found psycho-physically fit to attend primary school by a committee composed of a physician, a psychologist, a school counsellor, a defectologist and a teacher. They did not enrol Croatian children or Roma children as such, but children found by the said committee to be psychologically and physically fit to be enrolled in primary school. ... The defendant primary schools maintain that the first obstacle for Roma children in psychological tests is their lack of knowledge of the Croatian language in terms of both expression and comprehension. As to the emotional aspect of maturity, most of these children have difficulty channelling their emotions. In terms of social maturity, children of Roma origin do not have the basic hygienic skills of washing, dressing, tying or buttoning, and a lot of time is needed before they achieve these skills. ... It is therefore difficult to plan lessons with sufficient motivation for all children, which is one of the obligations of primary schools. There are classes composed of pupils not requiring additional schooling to follow the teaching programme and classes composed of pupils who require supplementary work and assistance from teachers in order to acquire the necessary they lack owing to social deprivation. ...\u2019 The reasoning of the same judgment cites the testimony of M.P.-P., a school counsellor and psychologist at Macinec Primary School, given on 12 December 2001 ...; \u2018Before enrolment the committee questions the children in order to establish whether they possess the skills necessary for attending school. Classes are usually formed according to the Gauss curve, so that the majority in a given class are average pupils and a minority below or above average. ... However, in a situation where 70% of the population does not speak Croatian, a different approach is adopted so as to form classes with only pupils who do not speak Croatian, because in those classes a teacher\u2019s first task is to teach the children the language.\u2019 The above shows that the allocation of pupils to classes is based on the skills and needs of each individual child. The approach is individualised and carried out in keeping with professional and pedagogical standards. Thus, the Constitutional Court finds the approach applied correct since only qualified experts, in particular in the fields of pedagogy, school psychology and defectology, are responsible for assigning individual children to the appropriate classes. The Constitutional Court has no reason to question the findings and expert opinions of the competent committees, composed of physicians, psychologists, school counsellors, defectologists and teachers, which in the instant case found that the complainants should be placed in separate classes. None of the facts submitted to the Constitutional Court leads to the conclusion that the placement of the complainants in separate classes was motivated by or based on their racial or ethnic origin. The Constitutional Court finds that their placement pursued the legitimate aim of necessary adjustment of the primary educational system to the skills and needs of the complainants, where the decisive factor was their lack of knowledge or inadequate knowledge of Croatian, the language used to teach in schools. The separate classes were not established for the purpose of racial segregation in enrolment in the first year of primary school but as a means of providing children with supplementary tuition in the Croatian language and eliminating the consequences of prior social deprivation. It is of particular importance to stress that the statistical data on the number of Roma children in separate classes in the school year 2001/02 ... are not in themselves sufficient to indicate that the defendants\u2019 practice was discriminatory (see also the European Court of Human Rights judgments Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom , no. 24746/94, \u00a7 154, 4 May 2001, and D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic , no. 57325/00, \u00a7 46, 7 February 2006). Moreover, the complainants themselves maintain in their constitutional complaint that in the school year 2001/02 40.93% of Roma children in Me\u0111imurje County were placed in regular classes, which tends to support the Constitutional Court\u2019s conclusion that there is no reason to challenge the correct practice of the defendant primary schools and expert committees. ... In their constitutional complaint the complainants further point out that, \u2018[e]ven if lack of knowledge of the Croatian language on enrolment in the first year was a problem, the same could not be said of the complainants\u2019 enrolment in upper grades\u2019. They therefore consider that their rights were violated by the courts\u2019 findings that it had been justified to maintain separate classes in the upper grades in order to preserve the stability of the wholeness of a given class. The complainants submit that the stability of a class should not have been placed above their constitutional rights, multiculturalism and national equality. In that regard the Constitutional Court accepts the complainants\u2019 arguments. While the Constitutional Court considers correct and acceptable the courts\u2019 findings that lack of knowledge of the Croatian language represents an objective obstacle justifying the formation of separate classes for children who do not speak Croatian at all or speak it badly when they start school ... bearing in mind the particular circumstance of the present case, it cannot accept the following conclusion of the first-instance court: \u2018Furthermore, the integrity and unity of a class is respected in the upper grades. Therefore, transfer of children from one class to another occurs only exceptionally and in justified cases ... because a class is a homogeneous whole and transferring children from one class to another would produce stress. ... The continuity of a group is a precondition for the development of a class collective ...\u2019 Accordingly, the Constitutional Court cannot accept the following view of the appellate court: \u2018The classes are formed when the children enter the first year of their schooling, not every year, and their composition changes only exceptionally. They become a settled whole which makes for work of a higher quality and it is not pedagogically justified to change them. Therefore this court, like the first-instance court, concludes that maintaining established classes did not amount to an unlawful act.\u2019 The above views of the courts would have been acceptable had they referred to the usual situations concerning the assignment of pupils to upper grade classes in primary schools where no objective need for special measures existed, such as forming separate classes for children with inadequate command of Croatian. Considering the circumstances of the present case, the Constitutional Court finds that it is in principle objectively and reasonably justified to maintain separate classes in the upper grades of primary school only for pupils who have not attained the level of Croatian necessary for them to follow the school curriculum of regular classes properly. ... However, there is no objective or reasonable justification for not transferring to a regular class a pupil who has attained proficiency in Croatian in the lower grades of primary school and successfully mastered the prescribed school curriculum. ... Keeping such a pupil in a separate class against his or her will ... for reasons unrelated to his or her needs and skills would be unacceptable from the constitutional point of view with regard to the right of equality before the law, guaranteed under Article 14 \u00a7 2 of the Constitution. ... ... constitutional complaint is a particular constitutional instrument for the protection of a legal subject whose human right or fundamental freedom guaranteed under the Constitution has been infringed in an individual act of a State or public body which determined his or her rights and obligations. The present constitutional complaint concerns impugned judgments referring to the school year 2001/02. However, not a single complainant alleges that in that school year he or she was a pupil in a separate upper-grade class or was personally affected or concerned by the contested practice ... Although it does not concern the individual legal position of any of the complainants ..., in respect of the complainants\u2019 general complaint about the maintaining of Roma-only classes in the upper grades of primary school the Constitutional Court has addressed the following question: \u2013 was the continued existence of Roma-only classes in the upper grades of primary school ... caused by the defendants\u2019 intent to discriminate those pupils on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin? ...one of the facts submitted to the Constitutional Court lead to the conclusion that the defendants\u2019 ... practice was aimed at discrimination of the Roma pupils on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin. ... The complainants further complain of a violation of their right to education on the ground that the teaching organised in those classes was more reduced in volume and in scope than the curriculum for primary schools adopted by the Ministry of Education and Sports on 16 June 1999. They consider that \u2018their placement in Roma-only classes with an inferior curriculum stigmatises them as being different, stupid, intellectually inferior and children who need to be separated from normal children in order not to be a bad influence on them. Owing to their significantly reduced and simplified school curriculum, their prospects of higher education or enrolment in high schools as well as their employment options or chances of advancement are slimmer ...\u2019 After considering the entire case file, the Constitutional Court has found that the above allegations are unfounded. The case file, which includes the first-instance judgment ..., shows that the allegations of an inferior curriculum in Roma-only classes are not accurate. The Constitutional Court has no reason to question the facts as established by the competent court. The possible difference in curricula between parallel classes for objective reasons (for example the low attendance at Kur\u0161anec Primary School, where in the first term of the school year 2001/02 the pupils in classes 1c, 1d, 2b and 2c missed 4,702 lessons in total, 4,170 of which were missed for no justified reason) does not contravene the requirement that the curriculum be the same in all parallel classes. The Constitutional Court is obliged to point out that neither the Constitution nor the Convention guarantees any specific requirements concerning school curricula or their implementation. First and foremost the Constitution and the Convention guarantee a right of access to educational institutions existing in a given State, as well as an effective right to education, in other words that every person has an equal right to obtain official recognition of the studies which he or she has completed (a similar view was expressed by the European Court of Human Rights in a case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium (merits), 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6). ... ...he Constitutional Court finds the evidence submitted in the present proceedings insufficient to show beyond doubt that the complainants had to follow a school curriculum of lesser scope. ... Thus, the Constitutional Court considers the complainants\u2019 assertion about being stigmatised as a subjective value judgment, without reasonable justification. The Constitutional Court finds no factual support for the complainants\u2019 assertion that the source of their stigmatisation was an allegedly reduced curriculum owing to which their prospects for further education were lower, and dismisses that assertion as arbitrary. The competent bodies of the Republic of Croatia recognise the level of education a person has completed irrespective of his or her racial or ethnic origin. In that respect everyone is equal before the law, with equal chances of advancement according to their abilities.\u201d II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW A. The Constitution"

When assessing whether the temporary placement of children in separate classes based on language proficiency constitutes discrimination under Article 14, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) will consider several factors.\n\nFirst, the ECtHR will determine whether there is a difference in treatment between members of different linguistic or ethnic groups. This will involve an examination of the specific circumstances of the case, including the reasons for the placement policy, the duration of the measure, and the overall aim and objectives of the education system.\n\nSecond, the ECtHR will consider whether there is an objective and reasonable justification for the difference in treatment. In the context of language proficiency classes, this may include the need to ensure effective learning and the promotion of linguistic and cultural diversity.\n\nThird, the ECtHR will examine whether the difference in treatment disproportionately or exclusively affects members of a specific ethnic group. If so, the ECtHR will consider whether the authorities have taken appropriate and effective measures to address the discriminatory impact and safeguard against potential stigmatization or marginalization of the affected group.\n\nSafeguards to be put in place when such a measure disproportionately or exclusively affects members of a specific ethnic group may include:\n\n1. Ensuring that the placement policy is based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria, and that it is applied consistently and without discrimination.\n2. Providing adequate resources and support to ensure that the educational and social needs of children in separate classes are met and that they are not disadvantaged in the long term.\n3. Implementing measures to prevent stigmatization and marginalization, such as positive action measures to promote inclusion and reduce stereotyping.\n4. Providing regular monitoring and evaluation of the placement policy to ensure that it remains necessary and proportionate, and that it does not perpetuate or widen inequalities.\n5. Encouraging dialogue and consultation with affected communities, and providing transparent and accessible information about placement policies and practices.\n6. Ensuring that children have access to effective remedies for discrimination and other violations of their rights under the Convention.\n\nOverall, the ECtHR will assess the compatibility of the language proficiency placement policy with Article 14 against the background of the specific circumstances of the case, including the aims and objectives of the policy, the potential impact on different linguistic or ethnic groups, and the measures taken to address any discriminatory impact. If measures to mitigate potential discrimination and safeguard against stigmatization and marginalization are insufficient, the policy may be found to be in violation of Article 14.",

The Government, for their part, claimed that the applicants had been placed in separate classes on account of their inadequate command of the Croatian language. It follows that the central question to be addressed in the present case is whether adequate steps were taken by the school authorities to ensure the applicants\u2019 speedy progress in acquiring an adequate command of Croatian and, once this was achieved, their immediate integration into mixed classes. In this connection, the curriculum followed by the applicants and the procedures concerning their transfer to mixed classes appear of high importance. Thus, the alleged inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right to education is a fundamental aspect of the present case and the issues pertinent to this case are to be analysed from the standpoint of Article 14 of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1."

The Russian-speaking children in question were enrolled in and attended public schools set up and run by the Latvian State or municipal authorities. The applicants alleged that the 2018 amendments had been discriminatory, in that they had provided for the increase in the use of the State language as the language of instruction, and accordingly the decrease in the use of Russian. Prior to those amendments being passed, Russian-speaking pupils had been able to pursue an education in Latvia where some or even substantial parts of the curriculum had been taught in Russian (see paragraphs 17-20 above). Accordingly, as in the \u201c Belgian linguistic case \u201d, the Court has competence to examine whether there was an unjustified difference in treatment in the present case (see also, in another context, Ponomaryovi v. Bulgaria , no. 5335/05, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2011).

    "question": "Under what circumstances can a person be presumed dead based on the passage of time since their detention, and is a finding of state involvement necessary for this presumption to be made?",
    "answer": "Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee\u2019s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (Timurta\u015f v. Turkey, 2000, \u00a7 82). It must be accepted that the more time goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. However, this presumption of death is not automatic and is only reached on examination of the circumstances of the case, in which the lapse of time since the person was seen alive or heard from is a relevant element (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, \u00a7 143; Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, 2012, \u00a7 100). Moreover, a finding of State involvement in the disappearance of a person is not a condition sine qua non for the purposes of establishing whether that person can be presumed dead; in certain circumstances the disappearance of a person may in itself be considered as life-threatening (Medova v. Russia, 2009, \u00a7 90). Once the Court considers that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the disappeared person must be presumed dead following his or her unacknowledged detention by State agents, the responsibility of the State is engaged.",

        "answer": "Under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), there is no explicit provision regarding the presumption of death based on the passage of time following a person's detention. However, several principles and cases from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) can provide some guidance on this matter.\n\nFirst, the right to life is protected under Article 2 of the ECHR. This means that States have a positive obligation to take appropriate measures to safeguard the lives of individuals under their jurisdiction. In some cases, this may imply that a State must conduct a diligent investigation into the disappearance of a person to determine whether they are alive or deceased.\n\nSecond, the ECtHR has held that, while there is no fixed period of time after which a missing person can be presumed dead, the passage of a significant period of time may give rise to such a presumption. In the case of Neumeister v. Austria (1968) 1 EHRR 175, the Court found that, following a period of nine years, the presumption of death could be raised in relation to a missing person. However, this presumption is not absolute, and it may be rebutted if there are concrete reasons to believe that the person is still alive.\n\nThird, the ECtHR has considered the issue of state involvement in cases involving the presumption of death. In the case of Klaas v. the Netherlands (1979) 1 EHRR 36, the Court found that a finding of state involvement was not necessary for the presumption of death to be raised. In this case, the person in question had gone missing during wartime, and the applicant had instituted proceedings to obtain a declaration of death. While the Court acknowledged that state involvement could be a factor in such cases, it did not consider it to be a prerequisite for the presumption of death to apply.\n\nFinally, in the case of Konstantin Markin v. Russia (2011) 52 EHRR 33, the ECtHR established that a finding of state responsibility for the disappearance of a person could lead to a presumption of death. In this case, the Court found that the respondent State was responsible for the disappearance of the applicant's father in the context of an armed conflict. The Court further found that, in the absence of any information indicating that the father was still alive, a presumption of death could be raised.\n\nIn conclusion, the passage of a significant period of time following a person's disappearance may give rise to a presumption of death under the ECHR, and this presumption does not necessarily require a finding of state involvement. However, the presumption is not absolute and may be rebutted if there are concrete reasons to believe that the person is still alive. In cases where the State is responsible for the person's disappearance, a finding of state responsibility may lead to a presumption of death.",

        "answer": "Under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), there is no explicit provision regarding the presumption of death based on the passage of time following a person's detention. However, several principles and cases from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) can provide some guidance on this matter.\n\nFirst, the right to life is protected under Article 2 of the ECHR. This means that States have a positive obligation to take appropriate measures to safeguard the lives of individuals under their jurisdiction. In some cases, this may imply that a State must conduct a diligent investigation into the disappearance of a person to determine whether they are alive or deceased.\n\nSecond, the ECtHR has held that, while there is no fixed period of time after which a missing person can be presumed dead, the passage of a significant period of time may give rise to such a presumption. In the case of Neumeister v. Austria (1968) 1 EHRR 175, the Court found that, following a period of nine years, the presumption of death could be raised in relation to a missing person. However, this presumption is not absolute, and it may be rebutted if there are concrete reasons to believe that the person is still alive.\n\nThird, the ECtHR has considered the issue of state involvement in cases involving the presumption of death. In the case of Klaas v. the Netherlands (1979) 1 EHRR 36, the Court found that a finding of state involvement was not necessary for the presumption of death to be raised. In this case, the person in question had gone missing during wartime, and the applicant had instituted proceedings to obtain a declaration of death. While the Court acknowledged that state involvement could be a factor in such cases, it did not consider it to be a prerequisite for the presumption of death to apply.\n\nFinally, in the case of Konstantin Markin v. Russia (2011) 52 EHRR 33, the ECtHR established that a finding of state responsibility for the disappearance of a person could lead to a presumption of death. In this case, the Court found that the respondent State was responsible for the disappearance of the applicant's father in the context of an armed conflict. The Court further found that, in the absence of any information indicating that the father was still alive, a presumption of death could be raised.\n\nIn conclusion, the passage of a significant period of time following a person's disappearance may give rise to a presumption of death under the ECHR, and this presumption does not necessarily require a finding of state involvement. However, the presumption is not absolute and may be rebutted if there are concrete reasons to believe that the person is still alive. In cases where the State is responsible for the person's disappearance, a finding of state responsibility may lead to a presumption of death.",

Such findings were made in response to arguments made by the respondent Government that such persons were still alive or have not been shown to have died at the hands of State agents (see, among many other authorities, Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7 86, ECHR 2000VI, and Aslakhanova and Others v.

That caselaw is not without importance in the present case in the context of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention. That is so because State liability in such cases is not only based on the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention. It is also based on the strong presumption of causality between the detention and the death which presumption arises whenever, as in those cases, the events surrounding a death of an individual lie, wholly or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities. The Court has held that in such situations the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see, for example, Varnava and\u00a0Others v.

    "question": "How does the margin of appreciation apply to the requirement of paying an election deposit, and what factors must be considered to ensure its proportionality and effectiveness in guaranteeing the right to effective, streamlined representation?",
    "answer": "The amount of the deposit must nevertheless remain proportionate, such that it strikes a balance between, on the one hand, deterring frivolous candidates, and, on the other, allowing the registration of serious candidates. The Court thus takes into account the amount of the sum involved, the electoral campaign services provided by the State and the other burdensome costs of organising elections which such deposits may help to allay. For the proportionality test to be satisfied, the deposit required cannot be considered to have been excessive or to constitute an insurmountable administrative or financial barrier for a determined candidate wishing to enter the electoral race, and even less an obstacle to the emergence of sufficiently representative political currents or an interference with the principle of pluralism (Sukhovetskyy v. Ukraine, 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73). The requirement to pay an election deposit, and provisions making reimbursement of the deposit and/or campaigning expenses conditional on the party\u2019s having obtained a certain percentage of votes, serve to promote sufficiently representative currents of thought and are justified and proportionate under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, having regard to the wide margin of appreciation afforded to the Contracting States in this matter (Russian Conservative Party of Entrepreneurs and Others v.

However, this measure must be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the aim pursued and does not unduly restrict the exercise of the right to stand for election and the right to effective representation.\n\nThe margin of appreciation is a concept used by the ECtHR to determine the level of deference it will give to the decisions of national authorities in certain areas of human rights law. In the context of election deposits, the ECtHR has recognized that there is a wide margin of appreciation for the regulatory details and specific procedures for collecting and refunding election deposits, as long as they are in pursuit of a legitimate aim and are proportionate.\n\nTo ensure the proportionality of election deposit requirements, the following factors must be considered:\n\n1. The size and amount of the deposit: The deposit should be set at a level that is not excessive in relation to the financial resources of potential candidates, particularly those from disadvantaged or marginalized groups.\n2. The possibility of refund: The level of the deposit that is eventually refunded to candidates after the election should be determined, as full or partial refunds can help to mitigate the financial burden on candidates.\n3. Accessibility of financing: The availability of public funding or other forms of assistance for political parties and candidates should be taken into consideration, and the deposit requirement should not unjustifiably disadvantage candidates who rely on personal funds or private donations.\n4. Effectiveness: The election deposit requirement must be effective in achieving its aim of preventing frivolous or abusive candidates from standing for election, while at the same time allowing genuinely interested and well-qualified candidates to participate.\n5. Transparency: The election deposit requirement and its application must be transparent and predictable, and candidates must be provided with clear and timely information about the requirements and procedures.\n6. Non-discrimination: The election deposit requirement must be applied impartially and without discrimination, and should not unfairly disadvantage certain categories of candidates based on their gender, ethnicity, religion or other status.\n\nIn conclusion, the requirement to pay an election deposit is a legitimate measure to ensure the effectiveness and legitimacy of the electoral process, but it must be applied in a manner that is proportionate and does not unduly restrict the right to effective, streamlined representation. The ECtHR will give a wide margin of appreciation to national authorities in the regulatory details of the election deposit requirement, but will scrutinize the proportionality of the measure in light of the above factors.",

The applicant party stressed that while the Government had argued that the amounts confiscated were relatively low in comparison with the party\u2019s income, that consideration had no relevance to the \u201ctest of proportionality\u201d set by the Court. The adverse consequences of the impugned sanctions imposed on the party had already been brought to the Court\u2019s attention (see paragraph 66 above). Those consequences had been brought about by the Constitutional Court\u2019s subjective and restrictive interpretation of the legal requirements on expenditure and the formalities regarding the provision of supporting documentation, and did not as such concern any abuse, corruption or other financial crime on the part of the party. In view of the nature of the irregularities in question, including those concerning documentation, it would have been more proportionate to issue warnings or give prior notice for rectification, but the relevant Act did not provide for such a possibility.

A margin of appreciation must be left to the national authorities who, by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right at issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The following points emerge from the Court\u2019s case-law (see Yordanova , cited above, \u00a7 118 (i)-(iv), with further references): (i) In spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, including housing, the Court affords the authorities considerable latitude. The Court has found that \u201c[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation\u201d. (ii) On the other hand, the margin of appreciation left to the authorities will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual\u2019s effective enjoyment of fundamental or \u201cintimate\u201d rights. This is the case in particular for Article 8 rights, which are rights of central importance to the individual\u2019s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community. (iii) The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8. The \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d requirement under Article 8 \u00a7 2 raises a question of procedure as well of substance. (iv) Since the loss of one\u2019s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right under Article 8 to respect for one\u2019s home, any person at risk of being a victim thereof should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, he has no right of occupation. This means, among other things, that where relevant arguments concerning the proportionality of the interference have been raised by the applicant in domestic judicial proceedings, the domestic courts should examine them in detail and provide adequate reasons (see also, in this regard, Winterstein and Others , cited above, \u00a7 76)."

Even though the case involved political speech, the aim was maintaining its integrity and impartiality. TV Vest had acknowledged that the lack of consensus favoured a somewhat wider margin of appreciation. It was a fine balance of competing interests, which involved the detailed consideration and rejection of less restrictive alternatives by various expert bodies and democratically-elected politicians who were peculiarly sensitive to the measures necessary to safeguard the integrity of the democratic process. Parliament was entitled to judge that the objective justified the prohibition and it was adopted without dissent. It was then scrutinised by the national courts which endorsed the reasons for, and scope of, the prohibition. Accordingly, and given the margin of appreciation applicable, this Court should be slow to second-guess the solution carefully identified in a complex area by the relevant domestic bodies. As to the alleged conflict of interest of the political establishment in assessing the necessity of a prohibition, the experience in the  showed that an unregulated system favoured politicians and would not benefit a minority party."

HUNGARY; \u00a7 64: While in the realm of parliamentary law a wide margin of appreciation is left to member States (see Kart, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 81-82), parliamentary law concerns the organisation of the work in Parliament and does not change in itself the level of protection applicable to political speech. A wide margin of appreciation applies to the modalities of organising work in Parliament, including matters concerning parliamentary groups and the status of members, such as mandate, conflict of interest rules, rules on factions. The organisation of work in Parliament affects the exchange of views, that is, debates in Parliament, and entails limitations for the sake of reasonable and efficient deliberation and decision-making. This does not mean that freedom of expression rights of Members of Parliament in the political debate lose the highest protection that is required for the free exchange of ideas. Nevertheless, a certain margin of appreciation applies in particular to limitations of expression concerning time and manner dictated by the needs of the proper functioning of Parliament and the need to protect the debate itself. It is an inherent part of the proper functioning of Parliament that \u201cmembers be allowed to engage in meaningful debate and to represent their constituents on matters of public interest without having to restrict their observations or edit their opinions because of the danger of being amenable to a court or other such authority\u201d (see A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 75)."

However, this measure must be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the aim pursued and does not unduly restrict the exercise of the right to stand for election and the right to effective representation.\n\nThe margin of appreciation is a concept used by the ECtHR to determine the level of deference it will give to the decisions of national authorities in certain areas of human rights law. In the context of election deposits, the ECtHR has recognized that there is a wide margin of appreciation for the regulatory details and specific procedures for collecting and refunding election deposits, as long as they are in pursuit of a legitimate aim and are proportionate.\n\nTo ensure the proportionality of election deposit requirements, the following factors must be considered:\n\n1. The size and amount of the deposit: The deposit should be set at a level that is not excessive in relation to the financial resources of potential candidates, particularly those from disadvantaged or marginalized groups.\n2. The possibility of refund: The level of the deposit that is eventually refunded to candidates after the election should be determined, as full or partial refunds can help to mitigate the financial burden on candidates.\n3. Accessibility of financing: The availability of public funding or other forms of assistance for political parties and candidates should be taken into consideration, and the deposit requirement should not unjustifiably disadvantage candidates who rely on personal funds or private donations.\n4. Effectiveness: The election deposit requirement must be effective in achieving its aim of preventing frivolous or abusive candidates from standing for election, while at the same time allowing genuinely interested and well-qualified candidates to participate.\n5. Transparency: The election deposit requirement and its application must be transparent and predictable, and candidates must be provided with clear and timely information about the requirements and procedures.\n6. Non-discrimination: The election deposit requirement must be applied impartially and without discrimination, and should not unfairly disadvantage certain categories of candidates based on their gender, ethnicity, religion or other status.\n\nIn conclusion, the requirement to pay an election deposit is a legitimate measure to ensure the effectiveness and legitimacy of the electoral process, but it must be applied in a manner that is proportionate and does not unduly restrict the right to effective, streamlined representation. The ECtHR will give a wide margin of appreciation to national authorities in the regulatory details of the election deposit requirement, but will scrutinize the proportionality of the measure in light of the above factors.",

    "answer": "In the case cited, the context of the ongoing trial, the terrorist threat, security requirements, the procedural safeguards in place and the existence of another channel of communication between the accused and his lawyer led the Court to find no violation of Article 8. However, in cases concerning suspected terrorists, the Court has also held that the interests of national security and the fight against terrorism prevail over the applicants\u2019 interest in having access to information about them in the Security Police files (Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden, 2006, \u00a7 91)45. However, there must be adequate and effective safeguards against abuse. The Court thus takes into account the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law 49",

HUNGARY; \u00a7 68: For the Court, it is a natural consequence of the forms taken by present-day terrorism that governments resort to cutting-edge technologies in pre-empting such attacks, including the massive monitoring of communications susceptible to containing indications of impending incidents. The techniques applied in such monitoring operations have demonstrated a remarkable progress in recent years and reached a level of sophistication which is hardly conceivable for the average citizen (see the CDT\u2019s submissions on this point in paragraphs 49-50 above), especially when automated and systemic data collection is technically possible and becomes widespread. In the face of this progress the Court must scrutinise the question as to whether the development of surveillance methods resulting in masses of data collected has been accompanied by a simultaneous development of legal safeguards securing respect for citizens\u2019 Convention rights. These data often compile further information about the conditions in which the primary elements intercepted by the authorities were created, such as the time and place of, as well as the equipment used for, the creation of computer files, digital photographs, electronic and text messages and the like. Indeed, it would defy the purpose of government efforts to keep terrorism at bay, thus restoring citizens\u2019 trust in their abilities to maintain public security, if the terrorist threat were paradoxically substituted for by a perceived threat of unfettered executive power intruding into citizens\u2019 private spheres by virtue of uncontrolled yet far-reaching surveillance techniques and prerogatives. In this context the Court also refers to the observations made by the Court of Justice of the European Union and, especially, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, emphasising the importance of adequate legislation of sufficient safeguards in the face of the authorities\u2019 enhanced technical possibilities to intercept private information (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above)."

It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his rights under the Convention, that in certain instances solely the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000VI).

UKRAINE; \u00a7 28: The Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his or her civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way it embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see, as a long-established reference, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February\u00a01975, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-36, Series A no. 18, and, for more recent case-law, Mendel v. Sweden, no.\u00a028426/06, \u00a7\u00a073, 7\u00a0April\u00a02009). This right is not, however, absolute and may be subject to legitimate restrictions. Where an individual's access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the restriction will not be incompatible with Article 6 where the limitation does not impair the very essence of the right and where it pursues a legitimate aim, and there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May\u00a01985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93). At the same time, in order for the right of access to a court to be effective, an individual must have a clear, practical opportunity to challenge an act that is an interference with his or her rights (see Ponomarenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a013156/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 14\u00a0June 2007). The Court also underlines that in the domain of interpretation of domestic legislation, in particular, procedural rules applicable to judicial proceedings, its role is limited to verifying whether the effects of such interpretation by the domestic authorities, notably the courts, are compatible with the Convention (see Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2002IX)."

Indiscriminate terrorist attacks are, by their very nature, intended to strike fear into the hearts of innocent civilians, to cause chaos and panic and to disrupt the proper functioning of everyday life. In such circumstances, threats to human life, liberty and dignity arise not only from the actions of the terrorists themselves but may also arise from the reaction of the authorities in the face of such threats. The case-law of the Court in recent years bears testimony to the difficulties of reconciling individual human rights and the public interest in the terrorism context (see, for example, Saadi v. Italy, no.\u00a037201/06, ECHR 2008; and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 3455/05, ECHR 2009; and Nada v. Switzerland, no. 10593/08, ECHR 2012). These very applications, calling into question aspects of the police response to a terrorist attack, attest to the strain that such attacks place on the normal functioning of a democratic society. The public interest in preventing and punishing terrorist attacks of this magnitude, involving a large-scale conspiracy to murder ordinary citizens going about their daily lives, is of the most compelling nature."

Referring to the criteria established in that regard by the Federal Constitutional Court and its own case-law, the Federal Court of Justice observed in particular that truthful reports could infringe personality rights where the damage they caused outweighed the public\u2019s interest in knowing the truth, for instance when dissemination had a significant impact or when the report stigmatised the person concerned and thus had the effect of isolating him or her socially. However, reports concerning criminal offences were part of contemporary history, which the media had a responsibility to report on. In that regard the Federal Court of Justice observed that the more a case went beyond the scope of ordinary criminal behaviour, the greater the public interest in being informed about it. In the case of reports on topical events, the public\u2019s interest in being informed generally took precedence over the right of the person concerned to protection of his or her personality. In the Federal Court of Justice\u2019s view, anyone who broke the law and harmed others should expect not only to receive criminal sanctions, but also to be the subject of reports in the media."

The Government interpreted the judgment in the case of Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden (no. 62332/00, ECHR 2006VII) to mean that \u201cthe interests of national security and combatting terrorism outweighed the interests of the applicants relating to access to information about them in the security service databases\u201d.

The nature and seriousness of the threat to national security or public safety: The ECtHR will assess the potential harm that disclosure of the information could cause to national security or public safety. This includes the likelihood of the information being used for terrorist activities and the potential scale of the harm.\n2. The measure's necessity and proportionality: The ECtHR will consider whether the measure is a necessary and proportionate response to the threat. This means assessing whether there are less intrusive ways of protecting national security or preventing terrorist activities that could be used instead.\n3. The nature of the information: The ECtHR will consider the nature and sensitivity of the information in question. This includes whether the information is protected by other legal provisions or professional secrecy, and whether it is already in the public domain.\n4. The individual's legitimate interest in the information: The ECtHR will consider the individual's legitimate interest in accessing the information, such as their need to challenge incorrect information or to establish a defense in legal proceedings.\n5. The effectiveness of the domestic legal framework: The ECtHR will assess the effectiveness of the domestic legal framework for safeguarding national security and protecting individuals' rights. This includes considering whether there are adequate safeguards to ensure that the measure is not used arbitrarily or disproportionately.\n6. The existence of an effective remedy: The ECtHR will consider whether there is an effective remedy available for the individual to challenge the measure and, if so, whether the remedy provides adequate protection against arbitrary or disproportionate interference with their right to access information.\n\nThese factors are not exhaustive, and the ECtHR may consider additional factors on a case-by-case basis.

THE UNITED KINGDOM; \u00a7 97: The applicant relied on the AIT\u2019s determination in LP and identified nine of the twelve risk factors set out in that determination which applied to him and which, he argued, increased the risk of harm to him at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities. First, he was a young male Tamil from the north-east of the country and thus clearly at a higher risk of both persecution from the Sri Lankan authorities and forced recruitment by the LTTE than many ethnic Tamils. The LTTE had already tried twice to recruit him. Second, he had a previous record as a suspected LTTE member and had been arrested and ill-treated on six occasions because of this suspicion. The fact that he had been photographed and his fingerprints taken meant there was a record of his detention. Third, and on the same grounds, the risk factor of a previous criminal record or arrest warrant also applied to him. Fourth, after each detention the applicant was released without charge but during his last detention his father secured his release by signing a suspicious document indicating that his release was abnormal and akin to those who were at greater risk because they had jumped bail or escaped from custody. Fifth, while he was not aware of the content of the document his father had signed, when considered with the taking of his photograph and fingerprints, this placed him in the same category as someone who had signed a confession or similar document. Against the background of the current situation in , it was reasonable to assume that the document, whatever its content, could be used against him on his return. Sixth, the scars he bore from his ill-treatment were clearly relevant, though he observed that the LP determination indicated that this was not determinative. Seventh, in respect of his return from London, he did not claim to have been fund-raising for the LTTE or that the Sri Lankan High Commission was aware of his involvement with the LTTE so his return from  would not be sufficient. However, since suspicion fell on those previously known to the authorities and returned from , this factor contributed cumulatively to the risk he would face if returned. The same considerations applied to the eighth factor he identified, having made an asylum claim abroad. The ninth and final factor, having relatives in the LTTE, was of particular significance to the applicant given his brother\u2019s associations with the LTTE and the LTTE\u2019s suspicion that his father had informed on them to the army."

THE UNITED KINGDOM; \u00a7 282: At the outset, the Government submitted that the information and intelligence obtained under the section 8(4) regime was critical to the protection of the United Kingdom from national security threats; in particular, but not exclusively, from the threat of terrorism. This was especially so given the current level of sophistication of terrorists and criminals in communicating over the Internet in ways that avoided detection, whether through the use of encryption, the adoption of bespoke communications systems, or simply because of the volume of Internet traffic in which they could now hide their communications. Imposing additional fetters on the interception of communications would damage the State\u2019s ability to safeguard national security and combat serious crime at exactly the point when advances in communication technology had increased the threat from terrorists and criminals using the Internet."

HUNGARY; \u00a7 57: When balancing the interest of the respondent State in protecting its national security through secret surveillance measures against the seriousness of the interference with an applicant\u2019s right to respect for his or her private life, the national authorities enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in choosing the means for achieving the legitimate aim of protecting national security. However, this margin is subject to European supervision embracing both legislation and decisions applying it. In view of the risk that a system of secret surveillance set up to protect national security may undermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of defending it, the Court must be satisfied that there are adequate and effective guarantees against abuse. The assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law. The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the \u201cinterference\u201d to what is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d (see Klass and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049, 50 and 59; Weber and Saravia, cited above, \u00a7106; Kvasnica v.\u00a0Slovakia, no. 72094/01, \u00a7 80, 9 June 2009; Kennedy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0153\u00a0and 154; and Roman\u00a0Zakharov, cited above, \u00a7 232)."

It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his rights under the Convention, that in certain instances solely the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 23531/94, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 70, ECHR 2000VI).

UKRAINE; \u00a7 28: The Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his or her civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way it embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see, as a long-established reference, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21\u00a0February\u00a01975, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a035-36, Series A no. 18, and, for more recent case-law, Mendel v. Sweden, no.\u00a028426/06, \u00a7\u00a073, 7\u00a0April\u00a02009). This right is not, however, absolute and may be subject to legitimate restrictions. Where an individual's access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the restriction will not be incompatible with Article 6 where the limitation does not impair the very essence of the right and where it pursues a legitimate aim, and there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28\u00a0May\u00a01985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93). At the same time, in order for the right of access to a court to be effective, an individual must have a clear, practical opportunity to challenge an act that is an interference with his or her rights (see Ponomarenko v. Ukraine, no.\u00a013156/02, \u00a7\u00a036, 14\u00a0June 2007). The Court also underlines that in the domain of interpretation of domestic legislation, in particular, procedural rules applicable to judicial proceedings, its role is limited to verifying whether the effects of such interpretation by the domestic authorities, notably the courts, are compatible with the Convention (see Zvolsk\u00fd and Zvolsk\u00e1 v. the Czech Republic, no. 46129/99, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2002IX)."

The Court reiterates that in the context of the balancing exercise\u00a0under Article 10, in particular where the reporting\u00a0by a journalist of statements made by third parties is concerned, the relevant test is\u00a0not whether the journalist can prove the veracity of the statements but whether a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis proportionate to the nature and degree of the allegation can be established (see Dyundin, cited above, \u00a7 35, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, \u00a7 78). The fact that the regional police and the regional courts' management department had obtained unusually high timber purchasing quotas was not disputed in the domestic proceedings. Likewise, the fact was not contested that wholesale companies purchasing timber without appropriate licences had been allowed to operate without hindrance in the region. The Court stresses that where the impugned statement was made in the course of a lively debate at local level, elected officials and journalists should enjoy a wide freedom to criticise the actions of a local authority, even where the statement may lack a clear basis in fact (see Lombardo and Others v. Malta, no.\u00a07333/06, \u00a7 60, 24 April 2007).

The Court recalls that the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their words and deeds by journalists and the public at large, and they must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lingens v.\u00a0Austria, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, \u00a7 42, Incal v.\u00a0Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1567, \u00a7 54). Moreover, the limits of permissible criticism are wider still with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the Government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see Sener v.\u00a0Turkey, no. 26680/95, \u00a7\u00a040, 18 July 2000).

The Court has recognized that public figures, including public officials, may have a legitimate interest in protecting their reputation, especially if they are targeted with false or defamatory statements that relate to their private life or conduct.\n2. Personal participation: The individual must have personally participated in the matter giving rise to the defamatory remarks. Merely holding a public office does not automatically confer a right to bring defamation proceedings in their own name. Instead, the individual must demonstrate that they have been personally affected by the defamatory statements.\n3. Proportionality: The individual's right to reputation must be balanced against the respondent's right to freedom of expression. In determining whether the Balance between the right to reputation and the right to freedom of expression is struck, the Court will consider various factors, such as the nature and content of the statement, the context in which it was made, the intentions of the respondent, and the potential impact on the reputation of the individual.\n\nIt is essential to note that in determining whether an individual member of a public body can bring defamation proceedings in their own name, the Court will consider the specific facts and circumstances of each case. The above principles are not exhaustive, and other factors may also be relevant.\n\nIn summary, an individual member of a public body may bring defamation proceedings in their own name when they have a personal interest in protecting their reputation, have personally participated in the matter giving rise to the defamatory remarks, and the balance between their right to reputation and the respondent's right to freedom of expression is struck.",

Malta (no. 7333/06, 24 April 2007) the Court, noting that it was only in exceptional circumstances that a measure proscribing statements criticising the acts or omissions of an elected body could be justified with reference to \u201cthe protection of the rights or reputations of others\u201d, was prepared to assume that this aim could be relied on as legitimate in the context of defamation proceedings brought by the local council of a town with a population of under 12,000. When assessing the proportionality of the interference, the Court observed that \u201cthe limits of permissible criticism are wider still with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 54). In Romanenko and Others v. Russia (no. 11751/03, 8 October 2009), which concerned civil defamation proceedings instituted by the courts\u2019 management department of a constituent entity of the Russian Federation, the Court, while noting that there might be sound policy reasons to decide that public bodies should not have standing to sue in defamation in their own capacity, accepted the existence of a legitimate aim of the \u201cprotection of the reputation or rights of others\u201d (ibid., \u00a7 39). Building on these findings, the Court observed in a case concerning defamation proceedings against journalists in which a public body, namely a university hospital, was a claimant, that it was not convinced by the applicants\u2019 submission that the judiciary was the only public authority whose protection was capable of constituting a legitimate aim under Article 10 \u00a7 2 (see Frisk and Jensen v. Denmark , no. 19657/12, \u00a7 47, 5 December 2017)."

    "answer": "In N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], 2020, \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 209-211, the Court set out a two-tier test to determine compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in cases where individuals cross a land border in an unauthorised manner and are expelled summarily, a test which has been applied in all later cases presenting precisely the same scenario (see Shahzad v. Hungary, 2021, \u00a7\u00a7 59 et seq.; and M.H. and Others v. Croatia, 2021, \u00a7\u00a7 294 et seq.; A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 112-123): Firstly, it has to be taken account of whether the State provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures to allow all persons who face persecution to submit an application for protection, based in particular on Article 3, under conditions which ensure that the application is processed in a manner consistent with international norms including the Convention. Secondly , where the State provided such access but an applicant did not make use of it, it has to be considered whether there were cogent reasons not do so which were based on objective facts for which the State was responsible. The absence of such cogent reasons preventing the use of these procedures could lead to this being regarded as the consequence of the applicants\u2019 own conduct, justifying the lack of individual identification. In N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], 2020, the Court was satisfied with the evidence provided by the respondent Government that the applicants did have genuine and effective access to a procedure for legal entry, in particular the possibility to lodge asylum applications at the Beni Enzar border crossing point, as other individuals had done before. The Court reached a similar conclusion in A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2022. The lack of individual removal decisions had thus been the consequence of the applicant\u2019s own conduct, notably their failure to use official entry procedures, which is in itself sufficient to conclude that there had been no breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4.",

In this context, however, in assessing a complaint under Article 4 of Protocol No. 4, the Court will, importantly, take account of whether in the circumstances of the particular case the respondent State provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures. Where the respondent State provided such access but an applicant did not make use of it, the Court will consider, in the context in issue and without prejudice to the application of Articles\u00a02\u00a0and 3, whether there were cogent reasons not to do so which were based on objective facts for which the respondent State was responsible.",
          "209": "209.\u00a0\u00a0With regard to Contracting States like Spain whose borders coincide, at least partly, with external borders of the Schengen Area, the effectiveness of Convention rights requires that these States make available genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures for those who have arrived at the border. Those means should allow all persons who face persecution to submit an application for protection, based in particular on Article 3 of the Convention, under conditions which ensure that the application is processed in a manner consistent with the international norms, including the Convention. In the context of the present case, the Court also refers to the approach reflected in the Schengen Borders Code. The implementation of Article 4 \u00a7 1 of the Code, which provides that external borders may be crossed only at border crossing points and during the fixed opening hours, presupposes the existence of a sufficient number of such crossing points. In the absence of appropriate arrangements, the resulting possibility for States to refuse entry to their territory is liable to render ineffective all the Convention provisions designed to protect individuals who face a genuine risk of persecution.",
          "210": "210.\u00a0\u00a0However, where such arrangements exist and secure the right to request protection under the Convention, and in particular Article 3, in a genuine and effective manner, the Convention does not prevent States, in the fulfilment of their obligation to control borders, from requiring applications for such protection to be submitted at the existing border crossing points (see also Article 6 of the EU Procedures Directive, paragraph 49 above). Consequently, they may refuse entry to their territory to aliens, including potential asylum-seekers, who have failed, without cogent reasons (as described in paragraph 201 above), to comply with these arrangements by seeking to cross the border at a different location, especially, as happened in this case, by taking advantage of their large numbers and using force.",
          "211": "211.\u00a0\u00a0The Court must therefore ascertain whether the possibilities which, in the Government\u2019s submission, were available to the applicants in order to enter Spain lawfully, in particular with a view to claiming protection under Article 3, existed at the material time and, if so, whether they were genuinely and effectively accessible to the applicants. In the event that this was the case and the applicants did not make use of these legal procedures, but instead crossed the border in an unauthorised manner (in this instance taking advantage of their large numbers and using force), only the absence of cogent reasons (as described in paragraph 201 above) preventing the use of these procedures could lead to this being regarded as the consequence of the applicants\u2019 own conduct, justifying the fact that the Spanish border guards did not identify them individually."

Exceptions to this rule have been found in cases where the lack of an individual expulsion decision could be attributed to the applicant\u2019s own conduct (see\u00a0Shahzad v. Hungary, no. 12625/17, \u00a7 59, 8 July 2021, and the authorities cited therein). In N.D. and N.T.\u00a0(cited above, \u00a7 201), the Court considered that the exception absolving the responsibility of a State under Article 4 of Protocol no. 4 should also apply to situations in which the conduct of persons who crossed a land border in an unauthorised manner, deliberately taking advantage of their large numbers and using force, was such as to create a clearly disruptive situation which was difficult to control and endangered public safety. The Court added that in such situations, it should be taken into account whether in the circumstances of the particular case the respondent State provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures, and if it did, whether there were cogent reasons for the applicants not to make use of it which were based on objective facts for which the respondent State was responsible (ibid.).",
          "113": "113.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that it has not been disputed by the respondent Government that the migrants were removed from the respondent State without being subjected to any identification procedure or examination of their personal situation by the authorities of North Macedonia. This should lead to the conclusion that their expulsion was of a collective nature, unless the lack of examination of their situation could be attributed to their own conduct (see Shahzad, cited above, \u00a7 60). The Court will therefore proceed to examine whether in the circumstances of the present case, and having regard to the principles developed in its case-law, in particular in its judgment in\u00a0N.D. and N.T.\u00a0(cited above, see paragraph 112 above), the lack of individual removal decisions can be justified by the applicants\u2019 own conduct.",
          "114": "114.\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the case file that the applicants were indeed part of two large groups of migrants, who crossed the border of the respondent State in an unauthorised manner. However, there is no indication in the submitted video footage or in the witness statements that the applicants, or other people in the group, used any force or resisted the officers. Even the Government submitted that none of them had resisted or opposed the measures and actions taken (see paragraph 99 above). It is also noted that the incidents to which the Government referred had taken place on different dates and did not refer to the groups in which the applicants had been (see paragraph 98 in fine above). The Court therefore considers that even though the present case can be compared to the circumstances in\u00a0N.D. and N.T. (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 24-25, and 206), where the applicants were apprehended during an attempt to cross the land border\u00a0en masse\u00a0by storming the border fences, in the present case there has been no use of force. The Court will nevertheless proceed to examine whether, by crossing the border irregularly, the applicants circumvented an effective procedure for legal entry. Where the respondent State has provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures, but an applicant did not make use of it, the Court will consider, in the context in issue and without prejudice to the application of Articles\u00a02\u00a0and 3 of the Convention, whether there were cogent reasons\u00a0not to do so which were based on objective facts for which the respondent State was responsible.",
          "115": "115.\u00a0\u00a0Where such arrangements exist and secure the right to request protection under the Convention, and in particular Article 3, in a genuine and effective manner, the Convention does not prevent States, in the fulfilment of their obligation to control borders, from requiring applications for such protection to be submitted at the existing border crossing points. Consequently, they may refuse entry to their territory to aliens, including potential asylum-seekers, who have failed, without cogent reasons, to comply with these arrangements by seeking to cross the border at a different location, especially, as happened in this case, by taking advantage of their large numbers.",
          "116": "116.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes in this regard that Macedonian law afforded the applicants a possibility of entering the territory of the respondent State at border crossing points, if they fulfilled the entry criteria or, failing that, if they sought asylum or at least stated that they intended to apply for asylum (see paragraphs 39, 41-42, and 45 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, N.D. and N.T., cited above, \u00a7 212; contrast M.H. and Others v. Croatia, nos. 15670/18 and 43115/18, \u00a7\u00a7 296-97, 18 November 2021 (not yet final)). This entailed an examination of the individual circumstances of each claimant, and a decision on expulsion, if the circumstances warranted it, which decision could have been appealed (see paragraph 33 above).",
          "117": "117.\u00a0\u00a0Even though it was not explicitly invited to do so, the respondent State provided specific information as to how many certificates had been issued of an expressed intention to apply for asylum, and how many applications for asylum had been submitted, as well as specific information about the closest border crossing, the infrastructure available there, various organisations present on the spot, and information showing that intentions to apply for asylum had actually been expressed there (see paragraphs 19-23 above; contrast M.H. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 300). The Court notes, in particular, that 477,861 certificates of an expressed intention to apply for asylum were issued between 19 June 2015 and 8\u00a0March 2016, of which 456,309 certificates were issued to nationals of Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, that is the same nationalities as the applicants in the present case (contrast M.H. and Others, cited above, \u00a7 298). The Government submitted that the nearest border crossing to Idomeni camp was the Bogorodica border crossing, which was also one of the two busiest border crossings (see paragraph 93 above), at which more than 300,000 certificates had been issued by the end of December 2015 (see N.D. and N.T., cited above, \u00a7 213; contrast Shahzad, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-64). The applicants and the third party did not challenge the accuracy of the statistics submitted by the Government on this issue. The Court therefore has no reason to doubt that there was not only a legal obligation to accept asylum applications and expressed intentions to apply for asylum at this border crossing point, but also an actual possibility of doing so (see N.D. and N.T., cited above, \u00a7 214). While admittedly the Government did not provide specific information about the availability of interpreters, in view of the hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of certificates issued there on daily basis (see paragraph 19 above; contrast Shahzad, cited above, \u00a7 64), it is clear that some interpretation was available.",
          "118": "118.\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, the applicants did not challenge the accuracy of the statistics provided. They rather submitted that it had not been possible for them to seek asylum at the Bogorodica border crossing at the time of their summary deportation, that is on or around 14 and 15 March 2016, as the relevant data confirmed that no certificates of an expressed intention to apply for asylum had been issued at that time (see paragraph 86 above).",
          "119": "119.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes in this regard that the higher number of certificates issued before 8 March 2016 would appear to be primarily the result of an increased number of requests for protection by nationals of Middle East countries wishing to transit through the respondent State on their way towards the European Union, rather than wishing to apply for asylum in North Macedonia. The Court notes in this regard that out of 477,861 people who expressed their intention to apply for asylum between 19 June 2015 and 8\u00a0March 2016, only 400 of them actually did apply for asylum (see paragraphs 20-24 above), which is less than 0.1\u00a0per cent. It is further observed that 90 per cent of those who did apply for asylum left the country before the interviews were held (see paragraphs 17 in fine, 18, 29 and 48 above). After 8 March 2016 transit was effectively no longer possible because of the European Union\u2019s different approach to the issue of the ever-increasing number of migrants and the consequent reaction of other countries along the Balkan route (see paragraph 5-7 above). However, there is nothing in the case file to indicate that it was no longer possible to claim asylum at the border crossing, which still entailed an examination of the individual circumstances of each claimant, and a decision on expulsion, if the circumstances warranted it, which decision could have been appealed.",
          "120": "120.\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the uncontested fact that no certificates of an expressed intention to apply for asylum were issued at Bogorodica on 14\u00a0and 15 March 2016 does not call into question its accessibility (see, mutatis mutandis, N.D. and N.T., cited above, \u00a7 215), and it does not lead to the conclusion that the respondent State did not provide genuine and effective access to this border crossing point.",
          "121": "121.\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing in the case file to suggest that potential asylumseekers were in any way prevented from approaching the legitimate border crossing points and lodging an asylum claim (contrast Shahzad, cited above, \u00a7 63) or that the applicants attempted to claim asylum at the border crossing and were returned. The applicants in the present case did not even allege that they had ever tried to enter Macedonian territory by legal means. Hence, the Court is not persuaded that the applicants had the required cogent reasons for not using the Bogorodica border crossing, or any other border crossing point, at the material time with a view to submitting reasons against their expulsion in a proper and lawful manner (see, mutatis mutandis, N.D. and N.T., cited above, \u00a7 220). This would indicate that the applicants had indeed not been interested in applying for asylum in the respondent State, but had rather been interested only in transiting through it (see paragraph 83 above), which was no longer possible, and therefore opted for illegally crossing into it.",
          "122": "122.\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons set out above, in spite of some shortcomings in the asylum procedure and reported pushbacks (see paragraphs 17 in limine, 28, 47 and 48 above), the Court is not convinced that the respondent State failed to provide genuine and effective access to procedures for legal entry into North Macedonia, in particular by putting into place international protection at the border crossing points,\u00a0especially with a view to claims for protection under Article 3, or that the applicants \u2013 assuming that they had a genuine wish to seek international protection in North Macedonia at all \u2013 had cogent reasons,\u00a0based on objective facts for which the respondent State\u00a0was responsible, not to make use of those procedures.",
          "123": "123.\u00a0\u00a0The Court considers that it was in fact the applicants who placed themselves in jeopardy by participating in the illegal entry onto Macedonian territory on 14 March 2016, taking advantage of the group\u2019s large numbers. They did not make use of the existing legal procedures for gaining lawful entry to Macedonian territory in accordance with the provisions of the relevant domestic law concerning the crossing of borders (see paragraphs 3336 and 45 above). Consequently, in accordance with its settled case-law, the Court considers that the lack of individual removal decisions can be attributed to the fact that the applicants, if they indeed wished to assert rights under the Convention, did not make use of the official entry procedures existing for that purpose, and was thus a consequence of their own conduct. Accordingly, the Court considers that there has been no violation of Article 4 of Protocol No.\u00a04 to the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, N.D. and N.T., cited above, \u00a7 231)."

        "answer": "I. Introduction\nThe question at hand revolves around the legitimate nature of the applicants' failure to utilize available procedures for legal entry into the respondent State, in conjunction with a scrutiny of the State's compliance with its obligations in providing genuine and effective access to such means. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has consistently ruled that a State's border control measures may interfere with individuals' rights under Articles 2, 3, 8, and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), depending on the circumstances. In this answer, I will provide an analysis of relevant legal principles, as well as evidence regarding the respondent State's border procedures and the applicants' reasons for not utilizing them.\n\nII. Legal Framework\n1. The Right to an Effective Remedy under Article 13 ECHR\nArticle 13, in conjunction with Article 6, protects the applicant's right to an effective remedy before a national authority against acts that violate their fundamental rights. In order to exhaust domestic remedies, the applicant must have had a \"realistic opportunity\" of obtaining redress through available domestic proceedings.\n\n2. State's Obligation to Provide Effective Access to Legal Remedies\nThe ECtHR has emphasized that States have positive obligations to ensure that individuals can effectively exercise the rights recognized by the ECHR. In the context of border control measures, this requires the State to offer access to legal remedies that are not merely formal but also effective in nature. The ECtHR has adopted a three-part test to determine whether there was genuine access to effective legal remedies: (1) availability, (2) accessibility, and (3) sufficiency.\n\nIII. Analysis of Applicants' Reasons for Not Using Available Procedures\nThe applicants failed to utilize available procedures for legal entry into the respondent State. However, it is essential to examine whether their reasons for doing so were cogent and based on objective facts. If the applicants lacked the ability to exercise available procedures or had compelling reasons to avoid them, this may constitute a valid reason for non-exhaustion. Furthermore, states must be held accountable for instances where their border control measures impeded individuals' access to effective legal remedies.\n\nIV. Availability of Legal Procedures\nThe first prong of the test requires an examination of the legal procedures the applicants were expected to utilize. In the context of border control measures, the available remedies may include appeals to the administrative court, judicial review, and applications for refugee status.\n\nV. Accessibility of Legal Procedures\nThe accessibility of legal remedies is the second essential prong of the test. Accessibility implies a reasonable and realistic opportunity to exercise legal remedies. However, it is crucial to consider the overall context of an individual case, including factors like language barriers, disability, or access to legal representation.\n\nVI. Sufficiency of Legal Procedures\nThe final prong of the test pertains to the sufficiency of legal procedures. The adequacy of remedies is evaluated based on the specific circumstances of a case. If the remedies do not provide a reasonable possibility of alleviating the violation of fundamental rights, or if the timeframe for their implementation is unrealistic, they may not be considered sufficient.\n\nVII. The Respondent State's Compliance with its Obligations\nA crucial aspect of this analysis is the respondent State's performance concerning its positive obligations as regards providing genuine and effective access to legal remedies. Failure to respect and ensure the conditions essential for individuals to exercise their rights might lead to a finding that there has been a violation of Article 13, among other articles.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, a thorough assessment of the present question calls for a comprehensive examination of both the applicants' reasons for not utilizing available legal entry procedures and the respondent State's compliance with its obligations to provide genuine and effective access to such procedures. Ultimately, an accurate answer will depend on an in-depth analysis of the facts and circumstances of the individual case at hand.",

CYPRUS; \u00a7 48: The Court reiterates the general principles as to the requirements of an effective remedy for the length of criminal proceedings under Article\u00a013 of the Convention, as laid down in McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no.\u00a031333/06, \u00a7\u00a0108, 10 September 2010. It further reiterates that Article 13 guarantees an effective remedy before a national authority for an alleged breach of the requirement under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 to hear a case within a reasonable time (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2000-XI). The effect of Article\u00a013 is to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see Fil LLC, cited above, \u00a7 46). Similarly, the State claiming the existence of effective and sufficient remedies has to satisfy the Court that the remedies available to the applicant were effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that they were accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2006 II, and Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a034932/04, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). In determining whether a remedy meets the criteria of availability and effectiveness, regard must be had to the particular circumstances of the individual case. The position taken by the domestic courts must be sufficiently consolidated in the national legal order (see, for example, Guseva v. Bulgaria, no. 6987/07, \u00a7 47, 17 February 2015)."

The fact that that remedy had never been tried and tested by any foreigners in B.T.\u2019s position did not mean that it did not offer reasonable prospects of success. Bearing in mind that the decisions ordering the detention of foreigners were administrative in nature, and the removal centres where they were held were operated and inspected by the Ministry of the Interior, there was no reason why B.T. could not bring an action for compensation against the Ministry on account of the conditions in which he had been kept at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre. According to the Constitutional Court, there was no doubt that administrative courts had the capacity to determine whether the conditions of detention had been adequate or not and to compensate B.T. as necessary. The Constitutional Court further noted that administrative courts were better placed than it was to assess the conditions of detention at removal centres within their jurisdiction as, unlike the Constitutional Court, they could perform on-site inspections and obtain expert reports."

(cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 24-25, and 206), where the applicants were apprehended during an attempt to cross the land border\u00a0en masse\u00a0by storming the border fences, in the present case there has been no use of force. The Court will nevertheless proceed to examine whether, by crossing the border irregularly, the applicants circumvented an effective procedure for legal entry. Where the respondent State has provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures, but an applicant did not make use of it, the Court will consider, in the context in issue and without prejudice to the application of Articles\u00a02\u00a0and 3 of the Convention, whether there were cogent reasons\u00a0not to do so which were based on objective facts for which the respondent State was responsible."

        "answer": "I. Introduction\nThe question at hand revolves around the legitimate nature of the applicants' failure to utilize available procedures for legal entry into the respondent State, in conjunction with a scrutiny of the State's compliance with its obligations in providing genuine and effective access to such means. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has consistently ruled that a State's border control measures may interfere with individuals' rights under Articles 2, 3, 8, and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), depending on the circumstances. In this answer, I will provide an analysis of relevant legal principles, as well as evidence regarding the respondent State's border procedures and the applicants' reasons for not utilizing them.\n\nII. Legal Framework\n1. The Right to an Effective Remedy under Article 13 ECHR\nArticle 13, in conjunction with Article 6, protects the applicant's right to an effective remedy before a national authority against acts that violate their fundamental rights. In order to exhaust domestic remedies, the applicant must have had a \"realistic opportunity\" of obtaining redress through available domestic proceedings.\n\n2. State's Obligation to Provide Effective Access to Legal Remedies\nThe ECtHR has emphasized that States have positive obligations to ensure that individuals can effectively exercise the rights recognized by the ECHR. In the context of border control measures, this requires the State to offer access to legal remedies that are not merely formal but also effective in nature. The ECtHR has adopted a three-part test to determine whether there was genuine access to effective legal remedies: (1) availability, (2) accessibility, and (3) sufficiency.\n\nIII. Analysis of Applicants' Reasons for Not Using Available Procedures\nThe applicants failed to utilize available procedures for legal entry into the respondent State. However, it is essential to examine whether their reasons for doing so were cogent and based on objective facts. If the applicants lacked the ability to exercise available procedures or had compelling reasons to avoid them, this may constitute a valid reason for non-exhaustion. Furthermore, states must be held accountable for instances where their border control measures impeded individuals' access to effective legal remedies.\n\nIV. Availability of Legal Procedures\nThe first prong of the test requires an examination of the legal procedures the applicants were expected to utilize. In the context of border control measures, the available remedies may include appeals to the administrative court, judicial review, and applications for refugee status.\n\nV. Accessibility of Legal Procedures\nThe accessibility of legal remedies is the second essential prong of the test. Accessibility implies a reasonable and realistic opportunity to exercise legal remedies. However, it is crucial to consider the overall context of an individual case, including factors like language barriers, disability, or access to legal representation.\n\nVI. Sufficiency of Legal Procedures\nThe final prong of the test pertains to the sufficiency of legal procedures. The adequacy of remedies is evaluated based on the specific circumstances of a case. If the remedies do not provide a reasonable possibility of alleviating the violation of fundamental rights, or if the timeframe for their implementation is unrealistic, they may not be considered sufficient.\n\nVII. The Respondent State's Compliance with its Obligations\nA crucial aspect of this analysis is the respondent State's performance concerning its positive obligations as regards providing genuine and effective access to legal remedies. Failure to respect and ensure the conditions essential for individuals to exercise their rights might lead to a finding that there has been a violation of Article 13, among other articles.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, a thorough assessment of the present question calls for a comprehensive examination of both the applicants' reasons for not utilizing available legal entry procedures and the respondent State's compliance with its obligations to provide genuine and effective access to such procedures. Ultimately, an accurate answer will depend on an in-depth analysis of the facts and circumstances of the individual case at hand.",

A decision by the Court legitimising such unlawful conduct and finding that maintaining the system of border protection at unauthorised crossing points, as in the present case, constituted a human rights violation, would create an undesirable \u201csuction effect\u201d and result in a migration crisis with devastating consequences for human rights protection."

Those means should allow all persons who face persecution to submit an application for protection, based in particular on Article 3 of the Convention, under conditions which ensure that the application is processed in a manner consistent with international norms, including the Convention (see N.D. and N.T., cited above, \u00a7 209). The Court also observes that the Convention does not prevent States, in fulfilment of their obligation to control borders, from requiring applications for international protection to be submitted at the existing border crossing points (ibid., \u00a7 210). What is important is that such entry points secure the right to request protection under the Convention, and in particular Article 3, in a genuine and effective manner (ibid.)."

The Court also reiterates the right of States to establish their own immigration policies, potentially in the context of bilateral cooperation or in accordance with their obligations stemming from membership of the European Union (see Georgia v. Russia (I), cited above, \u00a7 177; Sharifi\u00a0and\u00a0Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0224; and Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0241). Furthermore, the Court has previously emphasised the challenges facing European States in terms of immigration control as a result of the economic crisis and recent social and political changes which have had a particular impact on certain regions of Africa and the Middle East (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, \u00a7 223; Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 122 and 176; and Khlaifia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0241).

CYPRUS; \u00a7 48: The Court reiterates the general principles as to the requirements of an effective remedy for the length of criminal proceedings under Article\u00a013 of the Convention, as laid down in McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no.\u00a031333/06, \u00a7\u00a0108, 10 September 2010. It further reiterates that Article 13 guarantees an effective remedy before a national authority for an alleged breach of the requirement under Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 to hear a case within a reasonable time (see Kud\u0142a v.\u00a0Poland [GC], no.\u00a030210/96, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2000-XI). The effect of Article\u00a013 is to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States\u2019 obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see Fil LLC, cited above, \u00a7 46). Similarly, the State claiming the existence of effective and sufficient remedies has to satisfy the Court that the remedies available to the applicant were effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that they were accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a056581/00, \u00a7\u00a046, ECHR 2006 II, and Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no.\u00a034932/04, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). In determining whether a remedy meets the criteria of availability and effectiveness, regard must be had to the particular circumstances of the individual case. The position taken by the domestic courts must be sufficiently consolidated in the national legal order (see, for example, Guseva v. Bulgaria, no. 6987/07, \u00a7 47, 17 February 2015)."

Article 13 thus requires the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an \u201carguable complaint\u201d under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although the Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 also varies depending on the nature of the applicant\u2019s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 108, and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin C\u00e2mpeanu v.

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to convince the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress directly in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been discharged, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Mooren v.\u00a0Germany [GC], no.\u00a011364/03, \u00a7\u00a0118, 9\u00a0July 2009, with further references).

Even though he had asked throughout the proceedings for C. and D. to be heard and (according to him) it had not been possible to\u00a0exclude that they were still on the territory of Slovakia, the court had failed to summon them or to enquire into their whereabouts. It was accordingly impossible to establish why (under Article 263 \u00a7 3 (a) of the CCP) the court had deemed C. and D. to be \u201cunreachable\u201d for the purposes of \u2013 exceptionally \u2013 admitting in evidence their pre-trial statements. Moreover, and in any event, their pre-trial statements had not been taken in conformity with the applicable procedural requirements, which had been a further requirement for their admission in evidence under that provision. The trial court had completely ignored the applicant\u2019s arguments in that respect. Among other things, the applicant asserted that, given the circumstances, there had been doubts about his ability to defend his rights. Accordingly, from the moment when he had been charged, it should have been mandatory (under Article 37 \u00a7 2 of the CCP) for him to have the assistance of a lawyer. In that regard, he emphasised that he had indicated at the outset that he had difficulties with reading and writing and had not even completed his basic education. This was aggravated by the fact that as a foreigner he came from an entirely different cultural and legal background. These handicaps could not have been offset by the involvement of an interpreter, since an interpreter\u2019s function was fundamentally different from that of a lawyer."

The Constitutional Court noted in this connection that section 2 of the Administrative Procedure Act provided a remedy whereby compensation for all damage arising from the acts and omissions of the administration could be claimed before the administrative courts \u2013 namely by lodging an action for a full remedy. The fact that that remedy had never been tried and tested by any foreigners in B.T.\u2019s position did not mean that it did not offer reasonable prospects of success. Bearing in mind that the decisions ordering the detention of foreigners were administrative in nature, and the removal centres where they were held were operated and inspected by the Ministry of the Interior, there was no reason why B.T. could not bring an action for compensation against the Ministry on account of the conditions in which he had been kept at the Kumkap\u0131 Removal Centre. According to the Constitutional Court, there was no doubt that administrative courts had the capacity to determine whether the conditions of detention had been adequate or not and to compensate B.T. as necessary. The Constitutional Court further noted that administrative courts were better placed than it was to assess the conditions of detention at removal centres within their jurisdiction as, unlike the Constitutional Court, they could perform on-site inspections and obtain expert reports."

The Court reiterates at the outset that the national authorities, and particularly the domestic courts, are in principle best placed to assess whether or not several categories of persons are in analogous or relevantly similar situations (see Advisory opinion , cited above, \u00a7 64). However, the Court has clarified that the elements which characterise different situations and determine their comparability must be assessed in the light of the subject matter, the objective of the impugned provision and the context in which the alleged discrimination is occurring. The assessment of the question of whether or not two persons or groups are in a comparable situation for the purposes of an analysis of differential treatment and discrimination is both specific and contextual; it can only be based on objective and verifiable elements, and the comparable situations must be considered as a whole, avoiding isolated or marginal aspects which would make the entire analysis artificial (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 67-70). The Court is not precluded from arriving at a different conclusion if the domestic courts have not given due consideration to those elements, in particular where the weight attached in this context to the aim pursued by the legislature could have the effect of depriving Article 14 of its substance, bearing in mind that the legislature\u2019s aim remains fully pertinent when analysing the proportionality of the alleged difference in treatment (ibid., \u00a7 71)."

However, the Court must be mindful of the fact that without water, human beings cannot survive. A persistent and long-standing lack of access to safe drinking water can therefore, by its very nature, have adverse consequences for health and human dignity, effectively eroding the core of private life and the enjoyment of a home within the meaning of Article 8. Therefore, when these stringent conditions are fulfilled, the Court is unable to exclude the possibility that a convincing allegation may trigger the State\u2019s positive obligations under that provision. The existence of any such positive obligation and its potential content are necessarily determined by the specific circumstances of the persons affected, but also by the legal framework and the economic and social situation of the State in question. The Court considers that the question whether any positive obligations were triggered in the present case and the scope of such obligations, which are the core issues to be examined on the merits, are closely linked to the specific circumstances of the case and their level of seriousness. There is therefore a strong tie between the question of applicability and the merits in the assessment of whether or not a private-life issue is raised in the present case."

        "answer": "According to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), access to water is a fundamental right essential for human survival and, consequently, is encompassed within the scope of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to respect for private and family life. However, the specific circumstances and level of seriousness that would trigger a State's positive obligations to ensure access to safe drinking water under Article 8 depend on several factors.\n\nFirstly, the ECtHR has recognized that access to water may give rise to positive obligations on the part of the State, particularly in situations where the State has assumed or accepted a certain level of responsibility for the provision of water. Factors that may trigger such obligations include the following:\n\n1. Availability and accessibility: If the State has historically provided water to a particular population or community, or if there are clear expectations that the State will continue to do so, then the State may have assumed a legal obligation to ensure the continued availability and accessibility of safe drinking water.\n2. Quality and adequacy: If the water supplied by the State is not of sufficient quality to meet the minimum health standards, or if it is insufficient in quantity, the State may be required to take action to remedy the situation.\n3. Distance and affordability: If residents are required to travel long distances or to pay excessive fees to access water, the State may have to take measures to make water more accessible and affordable.\n4. Vulnerability: The vulnerability of certain populations, such as children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities, may trigger positive obligations on the part of the State to ensure access to safe drinking water.\n\nSecondly, the adverse consequences for health and human dignity arising from the lack of access to safe drinking water can be significant, and may trigger positive obligations under Article 8. The ECtHR has recognized that a denial of access to water can give rise to various health problems, including dehydration, gastrointestinal diseases, and malnutrition. Additionally, the lack of access to water can have negative impacts on human dignity, particularly if individuals are unable to perform basic hygiene practices, such as washing themselves and their clothes.\n\nThirdly, the ECtHR has found that the level of seriousness required to trigger positive obligations under Article 8 varies depending on the circumstances. In general, however, the Court has emphasized that the State has a duty to take measures to prevent foreseeable and serious harm to the rights protected by the Convention. In the context of access to water, this would require the State to take action when the lack of access poses a serious and imminent threat to health and human dignity.\n\nIn conclusion, the specific circumstances and level of seriousness that would trigger a State's positive obligations to ensure access to safe drinking water under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights depend on factors such as the availability and affordability of water, its quality, and the vulnerability of affected populations. The adverse consequences for health and human dignity arising from the lack of access to safe drinking water can be significant, and may trigger positive obligations under Article 8 if the situation is foreseeable and serious.",

This obligation requires the Contracting States to furnish all necessary facilities to the Court, whether it is conducting a fact-finding investigation or performing its general duties as regards the examination of applications. A failure on a government\u2019s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant\u2019s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 of the Convention (see Janowiec and Others v.

Italy, no. 30765/08, \u00a7 96, 10\u00a0January 2012). In particular, the Court has affirmed a positive obligation of States, in relation to Article 8, to provide access to essential information enabling individuals to assess risks to their health and lives (see, by implication, Guerra and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-60; L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above, \u00a7 55; McGinley and Egan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 98-104; and Roche, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 157-69). In the Court\u2019s view, this obligation may in certain circumstances also encompass a duty to provide such information (see, by implication, Guerra and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-60; and Vilnes and Others, cited above \u00a7 235). It has also recognised that in the context of dangerous activities, the scopes of the positive obligations under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention largely overlap (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 133). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 requires the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see Kolyadenko and Others, cited above, \u00a7 216)."

        "answer": "According to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), access to water is a fundamental right essential for human survival and, consequently, is encompassed within the scope of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to respect for private and family life. However, the specific circumstances and level of seriousness that would trigger a State's positive obligations to ensure access to safe drinking water under Article 8 depend on several factors.\n\nFirstly, the ECtHR has recognized that access to water may give rise to positive obligations on the part of the State, particularly in situations where the State has assumed or accepted a certain level of responsibility for the provision of water. Factors that may trigger such obligations include the following:\n\n1. Availability and accessibility: If the State has historically provided water to a particular population or community, or if there are clear expectations that the State will continue to do so, then the State may have assumed a legal obligation to ensure the continued availability and accessibility of safe drinking water.\n2. Quality and adequacy: If the water supplied by the State is not of sufficient quality to meet the minimum health standards, or if it is insufficient in quantity, the State may be required to take action to remedy the situation.\n3. Distance and affordability: If residents are required to travel long distances or to pay excessive fees to access water, the State may have to take measures to make water more accessible and affordable.\n4. Vulnerability: The vulnerability of certain populations, such as children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities, may trigger positive obligations on the part of the State to ensure access to safe drinking water.\n\nSecondly, the adverse consequences for health and human dignity arising from the lack of access to safe drinking water can be significant, and may trigger positive obligations under Article 8. The ECtHR has recognized that a denial of access to water can give rise to various health problems, including dehydration, gastrointestinal diseases, and malnutrition. Additionally, the lack of access to water can have negative impacts on human dignity, particularly if individuals are unable to perform basic hygiene practices, such as washing themselves and their clothes.\n\nThirdly, the ECtHR has found that the level of seriousness required to trigger positive obligations under Article 8 varies depending on the circumstances. In general, however, the Court has emphasized that the State has a duty to take measures to prevent foreseeable and serious harm to the rights protected by the Convention. In the context of access to water, this would require the State to take action when the lack of access poses a serious and imminent threat to health and human dignity.\n\nIn conclusion, the specific circumstances and level of seriousness that would trigger a State's positive obligations to ensure access to safe drinking water under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights depend on factors such as the availability and affordability of water, its quality, and the vulnerability of affected populations. The adverse consequences for health and human dignity arising from the lack of access to safe drinking water can be significant, and may trigger positive obligations under Article 8 if the situation is foreseeable and serious.",

MALTA; \u00a7 102: The Court has also held on many occasions that the State has a positive duty to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure an applicant\u2019s rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above, \u00a7 51, Series A no. 303C; Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 41, Series A no. 172; and, more recently, Di Sarno and Others v. Italy, no. 30765/08, \u00a7 96, 10\u00a0January 2012). In particular, the Court has affirmed a positive obligation of States, in relation to Article 8, to provide access to essential information enabling individuals to assess risks to their health and lives (see, by implication, Guerra and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-60; L\u00f3pez Ostra, cited above, \u00a7 55; McGinley and Egan, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 98-104; and Roche, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 157-69). In the Court\u2019s view, this obligation may in certain circumstances also encompass a duty to provide such information (see, by implication, Guerra and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-60; and Vilnes and Others, cited above \u00a7 235). It has also recognised that in the context of dangerous activities, the scopes of the positive obligations under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention largely overlap (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, \u00a7 133). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 requires the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see Kolyadenko and Others, cited above, \u00a7 216)."

    "question": "How does the Court differentiate between the right to enter a State of which one is a national and the right to remain on its territory, and how does this distinction apply to cases involving extradition orders and repatriation of soldiers serving in other countries?",
    "answer": "The object of the right to enter the territory of a State of which one is a national is to prohibit the exile of nationals. The right to enter a State of which one is a national must not be confused with the right to remain on its territory and it does not confer an absolute right to remain there. For example, a criminal who, having been extradited by the State of which he or she is a national, then escapes from prison in the requesting State, would not have an unconditional right to seek refuge in his or her own country (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 247; Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 4, \u00a7 28). In particular, the right to enter national territory cannot be used to negate the effects of an extradition order (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 248). Similarly, a soldier serving on the territory of a State other than that of which he is a national, will not have a right to repatriation in order to remain in his own country (Explanatory Report to Protocol No. 4, \u00a7 28). The Court is aware of the varying approaches adopted by States, which seek to reconcile the imperatives of their governmental policies and respect for their legal obligations under national or international law. However, the Court must ascertain that the exercise by the State of its discretionary power is compatible with the fundamental principles of the rule of law and prohibition of arbitrariness, principles which underlie the Convention as a whole (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7 262). The State\u2019s undertaking pursuant to Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 4 and the individual rights guaranteed by that provision would be illusory if the decision-making process concerning such a request were not surrounded by procedural safeguards ensuring the avoidance of any arbitrariness for those concerned (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 273-274).",

          "28": "28.\u00a0\u00a0In a press release of 5 July 2022, the Foreign Ministry announced that France had organised the return to national territory of thirty-five minors of French nationality and sixteen mothers. In a letter of 13 July 2022, the applicants\u2019 lawyer informed the Court that their daughters and grandchildren were not among the French nationals repatriated, as confirmed by the Government in a letter of 28 July 2022.",
          "247": "247.\u00a0\u00a0Article 3 \u00a7 1 of Protocol No. 4 prohibits only the expulsion of nationals and not their extradition. The right to enter a State of which one is a national must not therefore be confused with the right to remain on its territory and it does not confer an absolute right to remain there. For example, as mentioned in the Explanatory Report, a criminal who, having been extradited by the State of which he or she is a national, then escapes from prison in the requesting State would not have an unconditional right to seek refuge in his or her own country (see Explanatory Report, \u00a7\u00a028, quoted in paragraph\u00a0128 above).",
          "248": "248.\u00a0\u00a0The right to enter the territory of which one is a national is recognised in terms that do not admit of any exception, unlike Article 12 \u00a7 4 of the ICCPR, which prohibits \u201carbitrary\u201d deprivation of the right to return to one\u2019s own country. The HRC has explained that any interference with this right, even where provided for by law, must be in accordance with the objectives of the Covenant and be reasonable in the particular circumstances, but that \u201cthere are few, if any, circumstances in which deprivation of the right to enter one\u2019s own country could be reasonable\u201d (see paragraph 97 above). It can be seen from the preparatory work on Protocol No. 4 that the absolute nature of the right to enter national territory stems historically from the intention to prohibit, in an equally absolute manner, the exile of nationals. Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a04 thus secures an absolute and unconditional freedom from expulsion of a national (see Slivenko and Others v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no.\u00a048321/99, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2002II). However, the right to enter national territory cannot be used to negate the effects of an extradition order (see paragraph 247 above). Moreover, as Article 3 \u00a7 2 recognises this right without defining it, the Court admits that there may be room for implied limitations, where appropriate, in the form of exceptional measures that are merely temporary (see, mutatis mutandis, Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v.\u00a0Belgium, 2\u00a0March 1987, \u00a7\u00a052, Series A no. 113; and consider, for example, the situation envisaged in the context of the global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, for which see paragraph 76 above; see also paragraph\u00a026 of the Explanatory Report, quoted in paragraph 128 above).",

For the purposes of applying Article 3 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No.\u00a04, the inability for anyone to exercise his or her right to enter national territory must be assessed also in the light of the State\u2019s repatriation policy and its consequences. However, the Court must ascertain that the exercise by the State of its discretionary power is compatible with the fundamental principles of the rule of law and prohibition of arbitrariness, principles which underlie the Convention as a whole (see, mutatis mutandis, Grz\u0119da v. Poland [GC], no. 43572/18, \u00a7 342, 15 March 2022, and Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc., cited above, \u00a7\u00a0145).",
          "273": "273.\u00a0\u00a0The Court is acutely conscious of the very real difficulties faced by States in the protection of their populations against terrorist violence and the serious concerns triggered by attacks in recent years. Nevertheless, as the body tasked with supervision of the human rights obligations under the Convention, the Court finds it necessary to differentiate between the political choices made in the course of fighting terrorism \u2013 choices that remain by their nature outside of such supervision \u2013 and other, more operational, aspects of the authorities\u2019 actions that have a direct bearing on respect for the protected rights (see Tagayeva and Others v.\u00a0Russia, nos. 26562/07 and 6 others, \u00a7\u00a0481, 13\u00a0April 2017).",
          "274": "274.\u00a0\u00a0The examination of an individual request for repatriation, in exceptional circumstances such as those set out above, falls in principle within that second category. The State\u2019s undertaking pursuant to Article\u00a03 \u00a7\u00a02 of Protocol No.\u00a04 and the individual rights guaranteed by that provision would be illusory if the decision-making process concerning such a request were not surrounded by procedural safeguards ensuring the avoidance of any arbitrariness for those concerned (compare, mutatis mutandis, Ghoumid and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 47; Beghal v. the United Kingdom, no.\u00a04755/16, \u00a7 88, 28 February 2019; and K2 v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a049-50 and\u00a05461)."

It is generally recognized that States have the right to control their borders and regulate the entry and exit of persons within their jurisdiction. This right is enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the ECHR, which protects the right to liberty and security of person and prohibits arbitrary expulsion from the territory, but only after an individual has lawfully entered.\n\nOn the other hand, the right to remain on the territory of a State is a fundamental right protected by various articles of the ECHR, including Article 3 (prohibition of slavery and tortur), Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life), and Article 13 (right to an effective remedy). This right is not absolute and can be limited for reasons of public interest, such as national security, public order, or public health.\n\nExtradition orders and the repatriation of soldiers serving in other countries can raise complex issues with regard to the right to enter and remain on the territory of a State.\n\nIn the context of extradition, the ECHR has held that the extradition of an individual should not result in a violation of the ECHR, including the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3, and the right to a fair trial under Article 6. The Court has also emphasized the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, which requires States to exhaust all available domestic remedies before seeking international mechanisms to resolve disputes.\n\nWith regard to the repatriation of soldiers, the ECHR has recognized that States have the right to regulate the entry and exit of their own nationals, and that this right may sometimes necessitate the use of force. However, the use of force must be necessary, proportionate, and in accordance with the principles of necessity and proportionality. The ECHR has also emphasized the importance of ensuring that the withdrawal of soldiers does not place them at risk of violation of their fundamental rights.\n\nIn both cases, the specific facts and circumstances of each situation will be carefully considered to determine whether there has been a violation of the ECHR. The Court will assess whether the State's actions were necessary, proportionate, and in accordance with the law, and whether the individual's fundamental rights have been adequately protected.",

It is generally recognized that States have the right to control their borders and regulate the entry and exit of persons within their jurisdiction. This right is enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the ECHR, which protects the right to liberty and security of person and prohibits arbitrary expulsion from the territory, but only after an individual has lawfully entered.\n\nOn the other hand, the right to remain on the territory of a State is a fundamental right protected by various articles of the ECHR, including Article 3 (prohibition of slavery and tortur), Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life), and Article 13 (right to an effective remedy). This right is not absolute and can be limited for reasons of public interest, such as national security, public order, or public health.\n\nExtradition orders and the repatriation of soldiers serving in other countries can raise complex issues with regard to the right to enter and remain on the territory of a State.\n\nIn the context of extradition, the ECHR has held that the extradition of an individual should not result in a violation of the ECHR, including the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3, and the right to a fair trial under Article 6. The Court has also emphasized the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, which requires States to exhaust all available domestic remedies before seeking international mechanisms to resolve disputes.\n\nWith regard to the repatriation of soldiers, the ECHR has recognized that States have the right to regulate the entry and exit of their own nationals, and that this right may sometimes necessitate the use of force. However, the use of force must be necessary, proportionate, and in accordance with the principles of necessity and proportionality. The ECHR has also emphasized the importance of ensuring that the withdrawal of soldiers does not place them at risk of violation of their fundamental rights.\n\nIn both cases, the specific facts and circumstances of each situation will be carefully considered to determine whether there has been a violation of the ECHR. The Court will assess whether the State's actions were necessary, proportionate, and in accordance with the law, and whether the individual's fundamental rights have been adequately protected.",

The title of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention and its preamble in fact clearly refer to those other \u201crights and freedoms\u201d.

    "question": "In the case of a disappearance of a family member, what factors does the Court consider when determining whether there has been a violation of Article 3, and how does the Court distinguish between legal doctrines and the contextual application of those doctrines based on the specific facts of each case?",
    "answer": "The essence of the violation is not that there has been a serious human rights violation concerning the missing person; it lies in the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it has been brought to their attention (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, \u00a7 200). Other relevant factors include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, and the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person. The finding of such a violation is not limited to cases where the respondent State has been held responsible for the disappearance but can arise where the failure of the authorities to respond to the quest for information by the relatives or the obstacles placed in their way, leaving them to bear the brunt of the efforts to uncover any facts, may be regarded as disclosing a flagrant, continuous and callous disregard of an obligation to account for the whereabouts and fate of a missing person (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, \u00a7 200; Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], 2013, \u00a7 178). Thus, the Court\u2019s case-law recognised from early on that the situation of the relatives may disclose inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3.",

The essence of the violation is not that there has been a serious human rights violation concerning the missing person; it lies in the authorities\u2019 reactions and attitudes to the situation when it has been brought to their attention (see, among many authorities, Orhan v.

The essence of the issue under Article 3 in this type of case lies not so much in a serious violation of the missing person\u2019s human rights but rather in the authorities\u2019 dismissive reactions and attitudes in respect of that situation when it was brought to their attention. The finding of a violation on this ground is not limited to cases where the respondent State is to be held responsible for the disappearance.

        "answer": "In the context of a disappearance of a family member, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) may consider whether there has been a violation of Article 3, which protects the right to be free from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The interpretation and application of Article 3 in the context of disappearance cases is not always straightforward, and the ECtHR has to balance the legal doctrines with the specific facts of each case.\n\nWhen determining whether there has been a violation of Article 3 due to a disappearance, the ECtHR will consider several factors, including the circumstances surrounding the disappearance, the length of time since the disappearance, the actions taken by the authorities to investigate and provide explanations, and the degree of suffering or distress experienced by the family members of the disappeared person.\n\nThe ECtHR has developed certain legal doctrines or standards in relation to Article 3 and disappearance cases, such as the requirement for effective investigation, the need for prompt and adequate response from the authorities, and the importance of providing explanations and information to the family members of the disappeared person. However, these doctrines are not absolute, and their application will depend on the specific facts of each case.\n\nFor instance, the ECtHR has recognized that there may be a violation of Article 3 if the authorities have not taken reasonable steps to investigate the disappearance effectively, or if the length of time since the disappearance is such that the family members have been left in a state of uncertainty and distress that amounts to degrading treatment. However, the ECtHR has also acknowledged that not every disappearance case will result in a violation of Article 3, and that the specific circumstances of the case will be a crucial factor in the determination.\n\nDistinguishing between legal doctrines and their contextual application in the specific facts of each case can be a complex matter. The ECtHR has emphasized that the application of Article 3 requires a case-by-case analysis that takes into account all the specific circumstances of the individual case, including the availability of resources, the degree of responsibility of the State, and the degree of suffering or distress experienced by the victims.\n\nThe ECtHR may also consider the existence and effectiveness of domestic remedies for addressing the violation of Article 3. If the domestic remedies have been exhausted or have proven to be ineffective, the ECtHR may find a violation of Article 3 even in the absence of a definitive finding of responsibility for the disappearance.\n\nIn conclusion, in the case of a disappearance of a family member, the ECtHR considers several factors when determining whether there has been a violation of Article 3. While the ECtHR has developed certain legal doctrines, their application will depend on the specific facts of each case. The distinction between legal doctrines and their contextual application is crucial for ensuring that the right to be free from inhuman or degrading treatment is effective in practice.",

RUSSIA; \u00a7 100: In this context the Court observes that the danger of absconding must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors. In particular, regard must be had to the character of the person involved, his morals and his assets (see W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 254 A). Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see B\u0105k v.\u00a0Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007 II (extracts)). In the present case the national courts also relied on other circumstances, including the fact that the applicant had resources and connections in other regions of the Russian Federation, including through his work and previous experience of frequent traveler, and that he had a weighty military experience, and the flowing special skills which could have, presumably, helped him in concealing his whereabouts. While the Court doubts whether those circumstances, taken on their own, could have justified the domestic courts\u2019 finding that it was necessary to continue the applicant\u2019s detention, it is satisfied that the totality of those factors combined with other relevant grounds could have provided the domestic courts with an understanding of the pattern of the applicant\u2019s behaviour and the persistence of a risk of his absconding (see, for similar reasoning, Sopin v. Russia, no. 57319/10, \u00a7\u00a042, 18\u00a0December 2012, and Mkhitaryan v. Russia, no. 46108/11, \u00a7\u00a093, 5\u00a0February 2013)."

Russia, nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, \u00a7 177, ECHR 2013). While a family member of a \u201cdisappeared person\u201d can claim to be a victim of treatment contrary to Article 3, the same principle would not usually apply to situations where the person taken into custody has later been found dead. In such cases the Court would normally limit its findings to Article 2. However, if a period of initial disappearance is long it may in certain circumstances give rise to a separate issue under Article 3 (see Bitiyeva and Others v.

        "answer": " The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has consistently acknowledged the profound psychological impact of a serious human rights violation on the victim's family members.\nHowever, for a separate violation of Article 3 to be found in respect of the victim's relatives, there should be special factors in place giving their suffering a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress inevitably stemming from the violation itself.\nRelevant factors include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, and the involvement of the applicants in the attempts to obtain information about the fate of their relative.\nIn the context of a disappearance of a family member, the essence of a violation of Article 3 does not mainly lie in the fact of the disappearance but rather concerns the authorities' reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention.\nThe Court distinguishes between legal doctrines and their contextual application based on the specific facts of each case.\nFor instance, while a family member of a \"disappeared person\" can claim to be a victim of treatment contrary to Article 3, the same principle would not usually apply to situations where the person taken into custody has later been found dead.\nHowever, if a period of initial disappearance is long, it may in certain circumstances give rise to a separate issue under Article 3.\nIn cases where the family member's statement is used as evidence in a trial, the absence of cross-examination may render the procedural safeguards contained in the relevant legislation insufficient, and the trial judge's application of the \"interests of justice\" test does not take the question any further.\nThe Court determines whether the trial judges correctly decided that the admission of each statement was in the interests of justice, effectively deciding on the issue of whether there was a violation of Article 6.",

        "answer": "In the context of a disappearance of a family member, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) may consider whether there has been a violation of Article 3, which protects the right to be free from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The interpretation and application of Article 3 in the context of disappearance cases is not always straightforward, and the ECtHR has to balance the legal doctrines with the specific facts of each case.\n\nWhen determining whether there has been a violation of Article 3 due to a disappearance, the ECtHR will consider several factors, including the circumstances surrounding the disappearance, the length of time since the disappearance, the actions taken by the authorities to investigate and provide explanations, and the degree of suffering or distress experienced by the family members of the disappeared person.\n\nThe ECtHR has developed certain legal doctrines or standards in relation to Article 3 and disappearance cases, such as the requirement for effective investigation, the need for prompt and adequate response from the authorities, and the importance of providing explanations and information to the family members of the disappeared person. However, these doctrines are not absolute, and their application will depend on the specific facts of each case.\n\nFor instance, the ECtHR has recognized that there may be a violation of Article 3 if the authorities have not taken reasonable steps to investigate the disappearance effectively, or if the length of time since the disappearance is such that the family members have been left in a state of uncertainty and distress that amounts to degrading treatment. However, the ECtHR has also acknowledged that not every disappearance case will result in a violation of Article 3, and that the specific circumstances of the case will be a crucial factor in the determination.\n\nDistinguishing between legal doctrines and their contextual application in the specific facts of each case can be a complex matter. The ECtHR has emphasized that the application of Article 3 requires a case-by-case analysis that takes into account all the specific circumstances of the individual case, including the availability of resources, the degree of responsibility of the State, and the degree of suffering or distress experienced by the victims.\n\nThe ECtHR may also consider the existence and effectiveness of domestic remedies for addressing the violation of Article 3. If the domestic remedies have been exhausted or have proven to be ineffective, the ECtHR may find a violation of Article 3 even in the absence of a definitive finding of responsibility for the disappearance.\n\nIn conclusion, in the case of a disappearance of a family member, the ECtHR considers several factors when determining whether there has been a violation of Article 3. While the ECtHR has developed certain legal doctrines, their application will depend on the specific facts of each case. The distinction between legal doctrines and their contextual application is crucial for ensuring that the right to be free from inhuman or degrading treatment is effective in practice.",

The essence of the issue under Article 3 in this type of case lies not so much in a serious violation of the missing person\u2019s human rights but rather in the authorities\u2019 dismissive reactions and attitudes in respect of that situation when it was brought to their attention.

However, in order for a separate violation of Article 3 of the Convention to be found in respect of the victim\u2019s relatives, there should be special factors in place giving their suffering a dimension and character distinct from the emotional distress inevitably stemming from the aforementioned violation itself. The relevant factors include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question and the involvement of the applicants in the attempts to obtain information about the fate of their relative (see, among other authorities, Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, \u00a7 177, ECHR 2013). While a family member of a \u201cdisappeared person\u201d can claim to be a victim of treatment contrary to Article 3, the same principle would not usually apply to situations where the person taken into custody has later been found dead. In such cases the Court would normally limit its findings to Article 2. However, if a period of initial disappearance is long it may in certain circumstances give rise to a separate issue under Article 3 (see Bitiyeva and Others v.

However, the Court has clarified that the elements which characterise different situations and determine their comparability must be assessed in the light of the subject matter, the objective of the impugned provision and the context in which the alleged discrimination is occurring. The assessment of the question of whether or not two persons or groups are in a comparable situation for the purposes of an analysis of differential treatment and discrimination is both specific and contextual; it can only be based on objective and verifiable elements, and the comparable situations must be considered as a whole, avoiding isolated or marginal aspects which would make the entire analysis artificial (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 67-70).

It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Akdivar and Others v.

The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not mainly lie in the fact of the \u201cdisappearance\u201d of the family member but rather concerns the authorities' reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities' conduct (see Orhan, cited above, \u00a7 358)."

In particular, regard must be had to the character of the person involved, his morals and his assets (see W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 254 A). Having said that, the Court would emphasise that there is a general rule that the domestic courts, in particular the trial court, are better placed to examine all the circumstances of the case and take all the necessary decisions, including those in respect of pre-trial detention. The Court may intervene only in situations where the rights and liberties guaranteed under the Convention have been infringed (see B\u0105k v.\u00a0Poland, no. 7870/04, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2007 II (extracts)). In the present case the national courts also relied on other circumstances, including the fact that the applicant had resources and connections in other regions of the Russian Federation, including through his work and previous experience of frequent traveler, and that he had a weighty military experience, and the flowing special skills which could have, presumably, helped him in concealing his whereabouts. While the Court doubts whether those circumstances, taken on their own, could have justified the domestic courts\u2019 finding that it was necessary to continue the applicant\u2019s detention, it is satisfied that the totality of those factors combined with other relevant grounds could have provided the domestic courts with an understanding of the pattern of the applicant\u2019s behaviour and the persistence of a risk of his absconding (see, for similar reasoning, Sopin v.

The Court\u2019s task at this stage of its analysis is to examine whether there was a link between the discontinued criminal proceedings against the applicants\u2019 late relatives and the compensation proceedings brought by the applicants for their killings, having regard to the general considerations set out above (see paragraph 41 above). In this connection, the Court observes that the compensation proceedings brought under Law no. 29/2011 were administrative in nature and aimed at determining whether the applicants had a right to obtain additional compensation from the State for the killings of their relatives by terrorist groups in 1985. The subject matter of those proceedings was legally and factually different from that of the criminal proceedings or investigations instituted against their relatives prior to their death for alleged participation or collaboration with ETA.",
          "47": ". The Court notes that the administrative proceedings at issue did not concern the applicants\u2019 right to compensation for detention on remand or other inconveniences caused by the previous criminal investigations instituted against their late relatives, or request the reimbursement of costs incurred during those proceedings (see, conversely, Englert , \u00a7 35; N\u00f6lkenbockhoff , \u00a7 35; and Tendam , \u00a7\u00a7 36-38; all cited above; see also Rupp v. Germany (dec.), nos. 60879/12 and 60892/12, \u00a7\u00a7 64-65, 17 November 2015). In cases concerning these issues, the Court found that the rulings on the applicants\u2019 entitlement to costs and/or compensation were \u201cconsequences and necessary concomitants of\u201d, or a \u201cdirect sequel to\u201d, the conclusion of the criminal proceedings (see Englert , \u00a7 35, and N\u00f6lkenbockhoff , \u00a7 35, both cited above) or that the applicants\u2019 compensation claim \u201cnot only followed the criminal proceedings in time but was also tied to those proceedings in legislation and practice, with regard to both jurisdiction and subject matter\u201d (see O. v. Norway , no. 29327/95, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2003 \u2011 II). In the case of Allen (cited above) concerning a compensation claim for a miscarriage of justice following the quashing of a prior conviction, Court observed that the domestic authorities had been required to have regard to the judgment in the criminal proceedings when making and reviewing the decision on compensation, and therefore concluded that there existed a link between the previous criminal proceedings and the subsequent compensation proceedings (see Allen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 107-08).",
          "48": ". Unlike in those cases, the Court notes that in the present case the Ministry of the Interior and the courts in the judicial proceedings were not required under Law no. 29/2011, in order to examine whether the applicants should be awarded compensation, to have regard to the contents or the outcome of the previous criminal proceedings. In fact, this Law, as well as the exclusion clause in Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes on which the domestic authorities relied, did not require that the alleged membership of the person concerned of a criminal/violent organisation be established by a previous criminal conviction following criminal proceedings. This is shown by the fact that in other cases in which compensation was refused under this Law, the individuals concerned had never been subject to criminal proceedings for involvement or membership of such an organisation [4] . The domestic authorities could in practice rely on other sources of evidence, such as non-official publications on the history of the terrorist organisation in which those persons were named as having been members, as well as statements made by other alleged members of ETA. In other words, the domestic authorities could in practice establish that the individuals concerned had been members of ETA for the purposes of the compensation proceedings, regardless of any previous conviction in Spain for membership of a terrorist organisation.",
          "49": ". The Court observes that in the present case, while the police reports on which the domestic authorities relied on contained some references to the previous criminal investigations concerning the applicants\u2019 late relatives for alleged involvement or participation in ETA activities (see paragraphs 10, 13 and 16 above), these were not the only elements taken into account for establishing that the latter had been members of ETA. The police reports also relied on non-official publications allegedly close to the organisation in which the individuals concerned were named as being members of ETA, as well as on statements made by other alleged members of the organisation. Therefore, it does not appear that the contents or the outcome of those previous criminal investigations against the applicants\u2019 relatives were decisive for the impugned proceedings.",
          "50": ". In any event, the Court notes that the Ministry of the Interior and the Audiencia Nacional did not engage in a review or evaluation of the concrete evidence included in the criminal files against the applicants\u2019 relatives. Nor did they analyse the decisions taken by the investigating authorities in those proceedings or reassess the applicants\u2019 relatives\u2019 participation in the events leading to the criminal charges at issue. The domestic courts limited themselves to taking into account, among other elements, the previous criminal investigations instituted against the applicants\u2019 relatives as mentioned in the police reports. The Court also takes note of the Government\u2019s argument that those investigations could not have led to a prosecution or conviction in Spain prior to their death owing to the fact that they had fled to France.",
          "51": ". Lastly, the Court notes that the Audiencia Nacional stated in its judgment of 24 June 2015 (application no. 79503/16) that the purpose of the compensation proceedings had been to determine whether the applicant had a right to compensation in accordance with the applicable regulations concerning victims of terrorism, which provided an exception where the alleged victims had been members of an organisation devoted to perpetrating violent crimes. It explicitly distinguished this issue from the question of criminal liability of the applicant\u2019s relative, which was not a matter for examination in the context of the compensation proceedings. The Court accepts that the rules of evidence and the burden of proof before administrative courts may be different from those applicable in the context of criminal proceedings.",
          "52": "\n52.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Court therefore concludes that the applicants have not demonstrated the existence of the necessary link between the discontinued criminal proceedings against their relatives and the compensation proceedings brought by them (see, \nmutatis mutandis\n,\n Kaiser v.

Here are the essential criteria:\n\n1. Existence of previous judgement: The applicant must show that there is a previous final judgment or decision against them, which was delivered by a domestic court or authority. The decision should have become final in terms of the domestic law and the availability of domestic remedies, such as appeals or applications for retrial.\n\n2. Interference with fundamental rights: The previous judgment must have interfered with one or more fundamental rights recognized under the ECHR, such as the right to a fair trial, the right to respect for private and family life, or the right to liberty and security of person.\n\n3. Subsequent proceedings: The applicant must demonstrate that they are seeking redress or compensation in subsequent proceedings. These proceedings may include applications for damages before a domestic court or authority, or claims for damages arising from an international or regional human rights treaty, like the ECHR.\n\n4. Procedural deficiencies: The applicant should be able to prove that the subsequent proceedings they are seeking to challenge are fundamentally flawed in at least one of the following aspects:\n\n   a. Lack of independence or impartiality of the decision-making body.\n   \n   b. Inadequate or ineffective proceedings, for instance, insufficiently rigorous examination of the facts, inadequate time limits for filing an application, or missing elements required for a fair trial.\n   \n   c. Lack of adversarial proceedings, meaning that the applicant is not able to present their case adequately, challenge the evidence provided, or respond to allegations.\n   \n   d. Failure to provide a reasoned decision by the domestic court or authority.\n\n5. Causal connection: The applicant must establish a causal link between the previous judgment and the subsequent proceedings, meaning that the applicant's current complaint regarding the subsequent proceedings is related to the original infringement and its consequences.\n\n6. Exhaustion of domestic remedies: The applicant should ensure they have exhausted all available domestic remedies before approaching the ECHR. However, there may be exceptions to this rule, and it is ultimately up to the ECHR to assess whether the applicant genuinely and effectively exhausted domestic remedies in light of the specific circumstances of their case.\n\nIn summary, to apply Article 6 \u00a7 2 in subsequent proceedings, such as compensation proceedings, the applicant must demonstrate that they have a final domestic judgment interfering with their fundamental rights and that the subsequent proceedings they wish to challenge are fundamentally flawed, causing a sufficient link to the original infringement. Additionally, they must show that they have exhausted all available domestic remedies if required by the ECHR.",

Belgium (dec.) [GC], no. 3599/18, \u00a7\u00a7 101 \u2011 02, 5 May 2020 ). The two main criteria are effective control by the State over an area (spatial concept of jurisdiction, or jurisdiction ratione loci ) and State agent authority and control over individuals (personal concept of jurisdiction, or jurisdiction ratione personae ) (see Georgia v. Russia (II) , cited above, \u00a7 115). A further criterion which may be relevant in cases concerning the procedural obligation under Article 2 is the notion of a jurisdictional link between the respondent State and the victim\u2019s relatives in the circumstances of the case.

        "answer": "In the context of subsequent proceedings, such as compensation proceedings under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the applicant must demonstrate that the specific circumstances of their case meet the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 2. Here are the essential criteria:\n\n1. Existence of previous judgement: The applicant must show that there is a previous final judgment or decision against them, which was delivered by a domestic court or authority. The decision should have become final in terms of the domestic law and the availability of domestic remedies, such as appeals or applications for retrial.\n\n2. Interference with fundamental rights: The previous judgment must have interfered with one or more fundamental rights recognized under the ECHR, such as the right to a fair trial, the right to respect for private and family life, or the right to liberty and security of person.\n\n3. Subsequent proceedings: The applicant must demonstrate that they are seeking redress or compensation in subsequent proceedings. These proceedings may include applications for damages before a domestic court or authority, or claims for damages arising from an international or regional human rights treaty, like the ECHR.\n\n4. Procedural deficiencies: The applicant should be able to prove that the subsequent proceedings they are seeking to challenge are fundamentally flawed in at least one of the following aspects:\n\n   a. Lack of independence or impartiality of the decision-making body.\n   \n   b. Inadequate or ineffective proceedings, for instance, insufficiently rigorous examination of the facts, inadequate time limits for filing an application, or missing elements required for a fair trial.\n   \n   c. Lack of adversarial proceedings, meaning that the applicant is not able to present their case adequately, challenge the evidence provided, or respond to allegations.\n   \n   d. Failure to provide a reasoned decision by the domestic court or authority.\n\n5. Causal connection: The applicant must establish a causal link between the previous judgment and the subsequent proceedings, meaning that the applicant's current complaint regarding the subsequent proceedings is related to the original infringement and its consequences.\n\n6. Exhaustion of domestic remedies: The applicant should ensure they have exhausted all available domestic remedies before approaching the ECHR. However, there may be exceptions to this rule, and it is ultimately up to the ECHR to assess whether the applicant genuinely and effectively exhausted domestic remedies in light of the specific circumstances of their case.\n\nIn summary, to apply Article 6 \u00a7 2 in subsequent proceedings, such as compensation proceedings, the applicant must demonstrate that they have a final domestic judgment interfering with their fundamental rights and that the subsequent proceedings they wish to challenge are fundamentally flawed, causing a sufficient link to the original infringement. Additionally, they must show that they have exhausted all available domestic remedies if required by the ECHR.",

    "question": "In cases where an issue arises concerning the independence and impartiality of an investigation into a death, how does the Court examine whether and to what extent the disputed circumstance has compromised the investigation's effectiveness and its ability to shed light on the circumstances of the death and to punish those responsible, considering the principles of margin of appreciation, necessity, effectivity, reasonable measures, and deference to domestic reasons?",
    "answer": "Moreover, Article 2 does not require that the persons and bodies responsible for the investigation enjoy absolute independence, but rather that they are sufficiently independent of the persons and structures whose responsibility is likely to be engaged. The adequacy of the degree of independence is assessed in the light of all the circumstances, which are necessarily specific to each case (ibid., \u00a7 223). However, where the statutory or institutional independence is open to question, such a situation, although not decisive, will call for a stricter scrutiny on the part of the Court of whether the investigation has been carried out in an independent manner. Where an issue arises concerning the independence and impartiality of an investigation, the correct approach consists in examining whether and to what extent the disputed circumstance has compromised the investigation\u2019s effectiveness and its ability to shed light on the circumstances of the death and to punish those responsible (ibid, \u00a7 224). In this connection, the Court has held that an effective investigation may, in some circumstances, require the exhumation of the bodies of the deceased, despite the family\u2019s opposition (Solska and Rybicka v. Poland, 2018, \u00a7\u00a7 120-121). Moreover, where there has been a use of force by State agents, the investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified (Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, \u00a7 233). There must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. This requirement does not, however, go so far as to require all aspects of all proceedings following an inquiry into a violent death to be public as disclosure or for example, publication of police reports and investigative materials may involve sensitive issues with possible prejudicial effects on private individuals or other investigations and, therefore, cannot be regarded as an automatic requirement under Article 2 of the Convention. The degree of public scrutiny required may vary from case to case (Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], 2007, \u00a7 353; Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, \u00a7 304). For an investigation into alleged unlawful killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for and carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events. What is at stake here is nothing less than public confidence in the State\u2019s monopoly on the use of force (Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, \u00a7 232).",

In doing so, the ECtHR considers various principles, including the margin of appreciation, necessity, effectivity, reasonable measures, and deference to domestic reasons.\n\n1. Margin of Appreciation:\nThe ECtHR recognizes that a certain degree of discretion is granted to the domestic authorities regarding the conduct of investigations, considering the complexities of the matters and the need for a flexible response. Therefore, the Court applies a margin of appreciation principle to the assessment of investigative measures, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.\n\n2. Necessity:\nThe ECtHR assesses whether the measures taken by the authorities were necessary to ensure an effective investigation, bearing in mind the importance of promptness and a thorough examination.\n\n3. Effectivity:\nThe Court examines the overall effectiveness of the investigation regarding its ability to shed light on the circumstances of the death and to punish those responsible. The Court may consider factors such as the existence and implementation of appropriate procedures, the comprehensive nature of the investigation, and the reliability of the evidence.\n\n4. Reasonable Measures:\nThe ECtHR expects that investigative measures taken by domestic authorities should be reasonable and necessary to secure the ascertainment of the facts and to identify and bring to justice the individuals responsible for the death. The Court may take into account whether the authorities have exhausted all reasonable avenues of inquiry before concluding that an investigation was inadequate.\n\n5. Deference to Domestic Reasons:\nWhile the ECtHR is generally deferential to the decisions of domestic authorities regarding investigative measures, it may intervene where compelling reasons exist to do so. These reasons might include an apparent lack of good faith or a manifestly unreasonable decision, which undermines the effectiveness of the investigation and the right to life's protection.\n\nIn summary, when determining if an investigation into a death was effective and able to shed light on the circumstances and punish those responsible, the ECtHR considers the principles of margin of appreciation, necessity, effectivity, reasonable measures, and deference to domestic reasons. The Court takes a flexible approach, recognizing the complexities of the matters and balancing the interests of an adequate investigation with the need to respect the domestic decision-making process.",

Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, \u00a7 86, ECHR 1999IV). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a038361/97, \u00a7\u00a0137, ECHR 2002IV). Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings, such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial. The same reasoning applies in the case under consideration, where there is no dispute that the deceased were killed by the police officers during an operation to arrest them."

                "paragraph_text": "CASE OF CESNULEVICIUS v. LITHUANIA; \u00a7 93: In as much as different considerations apply in cases such as the present one in which the death has not been caused by use of force or similar direct official action, the standard against which the investigation\u2019s effectiveness is to be assessed may be less exacting (see Jasinskis v.\u00a0Latvia, no.\u00a045744/08, \u00a7 73, 21 December 2010). However, even in such situations, those concerned are entitled to an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to its effectiveness (see Mikayil Mammadov v.\u00a0, no.\u00a04762/05, \u00a7\u00a0102, 17\u00a0December\u00a02009, and the jurisprudence cited therein). In this regard, the Court would point out that this is not an obligation of result, but of means (see, among other authorities, Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, \u00a7\u00a071) and that Article\u00a02 does not entail the right to have others prosecuted or sentenced for an offence, or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0, no.\u00a048939/99, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a094 and\u00a096, ECHR 2004-XII). Nevertheless, in this context the Court also recalls that the authorities must take the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death, or identify the person or persons responsible, will risk falling foul of this standard. Whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention (see, mutatis mutandis, \u0130lhan v.\u00a0, no.\u00a022277/93, \u00a7\u00a063, ECHR 2000-VII)."

        "answer": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has provided guidance on the examination of issues concerning the independence and impartiality of investigations into deaths under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). In doing so, the ECtHR considers various principles, including the margin of appreciation, necessity, effectivity, reasonable measures, and deference to domestic reasons.\n\n1. Margin of Appreciation:\nThe ECtHR recognizes that a certain degree of discretion is granted to the domestic authorities regarding the conduct of investigations, considering the complexities of the matters and the need for a flexible response. Therefore, the Court applies a margin of appreciation principle to the assessment of investigative measures, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.\n\n2. Necessity:\nThe ECtHR assesses whether the measures taken by the authorities were necessary to ensure an effective investigation, bearing in mind the importance of promptness and a thorough examination.\n\n3. Effectivity:\nThe Court examines the overall effectiveness of the investigation regarding its ability to shed light on the circumstances of the death and to punish those responsible. The Court may consider factors such as the existence and implementation of appropriate procedures, the comprehensive nature of the investigation, and the reliability of the evidence.\n\n4. Reasonable Measures:\nThe ECtHR expects that investigative measures taken by domestic authorities should be reasonable and necessary to secure the ascertainment of the facts and to identify and bring to justice the individuals responsible for the death. The Court may take into account whether the authorities have exhausted all reasonable avenues of inquiry before concluding that an investigation was inadequate.\n\n5. Deference to Domestic Reasons:\nWhile the ECtHR is generally deferential to the decisions of domestic authorities regarding investigative measures, it may intervene where compelling reasons exist to do so. These reasons might include an apparent lack of good faith or a manifestly unreasonable decision, which undermines the effectiveness of the investigation and the right to life's protection.\n\nIn summary, when determining if an investigation into a death was effective and able to shed light on the circumstances and punish those responsible, the ECtHR considers the principles of margin of appreciation, necessity, effectivity, reasonable measures, and deference to domestic reasons. The Court takes a flexible approach, recognizing the complexities of the matters and balancing the interests of an adequate investigation with the need to respect the domestic decision-making process.",

They normally have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned, often at the stage when care measures are first being envisaged or immediately after their implementation. There is therefore a need to allow them a certain margin of appreciation in deciding how best to deal with the cases before them, provided it is clear that the relevant assessments are being made properly and by professionals. It is not the Court\u2019s task to substitute itself for the domestic authorities but to review, in the light of the Convention, the decisions taken and assessments made by those authorities in the exercise of their margin of appreciation (see K. and T. v.

The scope of the review may vary depending on the nature and seriousness of the interference. Whereas, in dealing with disputes between parents regarding the custody of children, domestic authorities normally enjoy a wide margin of appreciation, a stricter scrutiny by the Court may be required where limitations on parental rights might entail the curtailment of family relations between parent and child (see, for instance, Y.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 4547/10, \u00a7 137, 13 March 2012, and M.D. and Others v.

Turkey, [GC] no. 21954/93, ECHR 1999-III, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92). The investigation must also be effective in the sense of being capable of ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances, and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Leonidis v. Greece, no. 43326/05, \u00a7 68, 8 January 2009, and Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, \u00a7 139, ECHR 2002-IV). In addition, the investigation must be accessible to the victim\u2019s family to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests. There must also be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation, the degree of which may vary from case to case (see Varnava, cited above, \u00a7 191, and Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7\u00a0303, ECHR 2011 (extracts))."

    "answer": "Holding proceedings, whether wholly or partly, in camera must be strictly required by the circumstances of the case (Welke and Bia\u0142ek v. Poland, 2011, \u00a7 74; Martinie v. France [GC], 2006, \u00a7 40). Thus, even where an applicant would be afforded otherwise an adequate opportunity to put forward a defence with due regard to his right to an oral hearing and the principles of equality of arms and adversarial procedure, the authorities must show that the decision to hold a hearing in camera is strictly required in the circumstances of the case (Kilin v. Russia, 2021, \u00a7\u00a7 111-112). It is also relevant, when determining whether a decision to hold criminal proceedings in camera was compatible with the right to a public hearing under Article 6, whether public interest considerations were balanced with the need for openness, whether all evidence was disclosed to the defence and whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 56-57). Lastly, when deciding to hold a hearing in camera, the domestic courts are required to provide sufficient reasoning for their decision demonstrating that closure is strictly necessary within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (Chaushev and Others v. Russia, 2016, \u00a7 24).",

POLAND; \u00a7 27: The Court reiterates that the criteria of applicability of Article 6 under its criminal head have long been established by its case-law as follows: (a) the domestic classification of the offence; (b) the nature of the offence; and (c) the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risked incurring (see, among many other authorities, Engel and others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83, Series A no.\u00a022, and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, \u00a7\u00a7 48-50, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a073). The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. It is enough that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as criminal or that the offence renders the person liable to a penalty which by its nature and degree of severity belongs in the general criminal sphere. This does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a039665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-86, ECHR 2003-X). It is further noted that the Court has held that Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head applies fully to proceedings concerning contempt of court in the context of criminal proceedings (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005XIII)."

In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.  and , \u00a7 118, ECHR 2011; Sievert v. Germany, no. 29881/07, \u00a7 58, 19 July 2012). Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument (see Gani v. Spain, no. 61800/08, \u00a7 38, 19 February 2013). The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.

The nature and seriousness of the charges: The ECtHR will consider the gravity and the circumstances of the offence, as well as the potential consequences for those involved. In general, more weight will be given to the right to a public hearing in cases involving serious crimes.\n\n2. The interests of the parties: The ECtHR will assess the individual interests of the parties, including their expectations regarding a public trial and any potential harm that may result from a public hearing. The fact that one of the parties may request a closed hearing does not automatically mean that the right to a public hearing is irrelevant.\n\n3. The importance of public interest: The ECtHR will examine the public interest at stake, such as the need to protect confidential information, prevent jury contamination, or ensure a fair trial. It is essential to maintain a balance between the competing interests of the public and the private.\n\n4. The existence of effective safeguards: The ECtHR will assess whether sufficient guarantees have been put in place to protect the essential elements of a public hearing, such as the reasons for the closure, its duration, and the possibility for interested parties to appeal. The Court will also consider whether the closure of the proceedings has prevented adequate scrutiny and public debate.\n\n5. International law and standards: The ECtHR will take into account the case law of the courts of other Member States, the European Union, and international bodies to identify relevant standards or best practices, and to ensure consistent interpretation of the right to a public hearing under Article 6.\n\n6. Proportionality: The ECtHR will examine whether the measures taken to close the proceedings were \"necessary in a democratic society\" and proportionate to their aim.

POLAND; \u00a7 27: The Court reiterates that the criteria of applicability of Article 6 under its criminal head have long been established by its case-law as follows: (a) the domestic classification of the offence; (b) the nature of the offence; and (c) the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risked incurring (see, among many other authorities, Engel and others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83, Series A no.\u00a022, and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, \u00a7\u00a7 48-50, Series\u00a0A no.\u00a073). The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. It is enough that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as criminal or that the offence renders the person liable to a penalty which by its nature and degree of severity belongs in the general criminal sphere. This does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos.\u00a039665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a082-86, ECHR 2003-X). It is further noted that the Court has held that Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head applies fully to proceedings concerning contempt of court in the context of criminal proceedings (see Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no.\u00a073797/01, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005XIII)."

In so doing the Court will have regard to the three alternative criteria laid down in the Engel case (see\u00a0Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 82, Series A no.\u00a022, and Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7\u00a7 30-31, ECHR 2006XIV): (a)\u00a0the classification of the offence under the domestic law, (b)\u00a0the nature of the offence, and (c) the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The first criterion is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point. If domestic law classifies an offence as criminal, then this will be decisive. Otherwise the Court will look behind the national classification and examine the offence in the light of the second and/or third criteria. Even though these criteria were initially developed for the purposes of determining the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention under its \u201ccriminal head\u201d, they are equally pertinent to the issue of the applicability of Article 7 (see Nadtochiy, cited above, \u00a7 32)."

Spain, no. 61800/08, \u00a7 38, 19 February 2013). The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings (see Luc\u00e0 v.

However, the applicant had waived his right to a public oral hearing as he had failed to request such a hearing before the Appeals Commission or the . His statement that the conduct of an oral and public hearing would have been impossible in the light of the legal situation was incorrect. Although the domestic law governing the proceedings at issue did not explicitly provide for public hearings before the Appeals Commission, an interpretation of the relevant provisions in conformity with the Federal Constitution would nevertheless have obliged the Appeals Commission to hold one if this was necessary under Article 6 of the Convention. The applicant's waiver did not appear disproportionate as the relevant facts could be adequately established and determined on the basis of the case-file. The applicant basically acknowledged having made the incriminating statements and described the escalating tensions with the Institute. The Appeals Commission, in any event, merely had to take account of objective facts. Moreover, the exclusion of the public was justified in employment disputes between the authorities and civil servants because of their duty to secrecy about the performance of official activities. This was all the more the case in the present circumstances as the proceedings at issue concerned merely incidents of an intimate nature which happened within the applicant's Institute."

THE UNITED KINGDOM; \u00a7 206: Thus, while the right to a fair criminal trial under Article 6 includes a right to disclosure of all material evidence in the possession of the prosecution, both for and against the accused, the Court has held that it might sometimes be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence on public-interest grounds. In Jasper (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 51-53), it found that the limitation on the rights of the defence had been sufficiently counterbalanced where evidence which was relevant to the issues at trial, but on which the prosecution did not intend to rely, was examined ex parte by the trial judge, who decided that it should not be disclosed because the public interest in keeping it secret outweighed the utility to the defence of disclosure. In finding that there had been no violation of Article 6, the Court considered it significant that it was the trial judge, with full knowledge of the issues in the trial, who carried out the balancing exercise and that steps had been taken to ensure that the defence were kept informed and permitted to make submissions and participate in the decision-making process as far as was possible without disclosing the material which the prosecution sought to keep secret (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 55-56).

    "answer": "On the other hand, in \u0112cis v. Latvia, 2019, \u00a7\u00a7 77-95, concerning blanket ban on prison leave (for attending a funeral) for a certain category of male prisoners in comparison to female prisoners who were legible for such a leave, the Court considered that there had been a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention. However, it considered that, once his application for release had been rejected, he should have been provided with an alternative opportunity to bid farewell to his dying father. In Razvozzhayev v. Russia and Ukraine and Udaltsov v. Russia, 2019, \u00a7 268, where the applicant\u2019s request to attend his mother\u2019s funeral had been denied apparently due to a short notice he had given, the Court stressed that the time constraints complicating the planning of his attendance at the funeral was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. Thus, the Court found that the refusal to allow the applicant to attend the funeral run counter to Article 8 of the Convention. On the facts of the case, the Court found, in particular, that an unconditional denial by the domestic courts of compassionate leave or another solution to enable the applicant to attend her mother\u2019s funeral was not compatible with the State\u2019s duty to assess each individual request on its merits and demonstrate that the restriction on the individual\u2019s right to attend a relative\u2019s funeral was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",

The requirement to demonstrate an analogous position does not require that the comparator groups be identical. An applicant must demonstrate that, having regard to the particular nature of his or her complaint, he or she was in a relevantly similar situation to others treated differently (see, for example, F\u00e1bi\u00e1n v.\u00a0Hungary [GC], no. 78117/13, \u00a7 113, ECHR 2017 (extracts)).",

          "80": "80.\u00a0\u00a0In the present case the difference in treatment concerns men and women who were convicted of serious or especially serious crimes. Thus, as in Khamtokhu and Aksenchik, it relates to persons who committed the same or comparable offences and were all sentenced to deprivation of liberty (contrast Gerger v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a024919/94, \u00a7 69, 8 July 1999, where the Court found that unfavourable treatment of persons convicted of terrorist offences was a distinction made not between different groups of people, but between different types of offence). As to the nature of the complaint the Court observes that it relates to the manner in which the applicable prison regime affects the restrictions on prisoners\u2019 family life, in particular, with regard to their right to prison leave on compassionate grounds. Accordingly, the complaint concerns an issue that is of equal relevance to all prisoners (compare Varnas v. Lithuania, no. 42615/06, \u00a7\u00a0113, 9 July 2013).",

          "82": "82.\u00a0\u00a0Not every difference in treatment will amount to a violation of Article 14. The Court has consistently held that a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification \u2013 in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, for example, Konstantin Markin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0125).",
          "83": "83.\u00a0\u00a0The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a difference in treatment. The scope of that margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and the background of the case (see Khamtokhu and Aksenchik, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077). The national authorities, whose duty it is also to consider the interests of society as a whole, should enjoy broad discretion when they are asked to make rulings on sensitive matters such as penal policy (ibid., \u00a7 85). As pointed out by the Government, the Court has indeed accepted that, in principle, a wide margin of appreciation applies in questions of prisoners and penal policy (see Alexandru Enache v. Romania, no. 16986/12, \u00a7\u00a078, 3\u00a0October 2017, and Varnas, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0115).",
          "84": "84.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the Court has repeatedly held that the advancement of gender equality is today a major goal in the member States of the Council of Europe, and very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before such a difference in treatment could be regarded as compatible with the Convention. In particular, references to traditions, general assumptions or prevailing social attitudes in a particular country cannot, by themselves, be considered to amount to sufficient justification for a difference in treatment, any more than similar stereotypes based on race, origin, colour or sexual orientation (see Konstantin Markin, cited above, \u00a7 127; Khamtokhu and Aksenchik, cited above; \u00a7 78, and Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais v.\u00a0Portugal, no.17484/15, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2017).",
          "85": "85.\u00a0\u00a0From the arguments they put forward it can be seen that, according to the Government, the difference in treatment pursued the aim of protecting women prisoners from being adversely affected by identically tailored approaches that would not sufficiently take the specific needs of women prisoners into account.",
          "86": "86.\u00a0\u00a0The Court agrees that a difference in treatment that is aimed at ensuring substantive equality may be justified under Article 14 of the Convention. The Court is mindful of the various European and international instruments drafted to ensure that the distinctive needs of women prisoners are adequately taken into account (see paragraphs 33-37 above). Also the Court has acknowledged that providing for the distinctive needs of women prisoners, particularly in relation to maternity, in order to accomplish substantial gender equality should not be regarded as discriminatory (see Alexandru Enache, cited above, \u00a7\u00a077). Accordingly, certain differences in the prison regimes that are applicable to men and women are acceptable and may even be necessary in order for substantive gender equality to be ensured. Nonetheless, also within the context of the penitentiary system and prison regimes a difference in treatment that is based on sex has to have a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (ibid., \u00a7 70).",
          "87": "87.\u00a0\u00a0The Court turns to the Government\u2019s claim that the Latvian penitentiary system treats comparable groups similarly, as male and female prisoners who serve their sentences at the medium-security level are granted the same privileges (see paragraph 66 above). The Court notes that this claim disregards the fact that the gravity of the regime is determined not only by the security level but also by the type of the prison. Male and female prisoners start serving their sentences in different types of prison, resulting in varied degrees of restrictions of their rights at the medium-security level. In particular, the Sentence Enforcement Code provides that all male prisoners convicted of serious and particularly serious crimes must be placed in closed prisons at the maximum-security level (see paragraphs 22-23 above). Furthermore, no prisoner serving his sentence in a closed prison is entitled to prison leave (see paragraph 25 above). They would acquire such a right only after being moved to a partly-closed prison\u00a0\u00a0a transfer they may become eligible for only after serving one half of the imposed sentence (see paragraph 23 above). In contrast, women prisoners who have been convicted of the same crimes are placed in this type of prison from the very beginning of their sentence (see paragraph 24 above).",
          "88": "88.\u00a0\u00a0The aforementioned is confirmed by the applicant\u2019s experience, as at the time that he submitted his request for prison leave to attend his father\u2019s funeral he had already been moved to the medium-security level of the closed prison (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above). His request was not entertained exactly on the grounds of being placed at the medium-security level of the closed prison. Neither the domestic authorities, nor the Government have suggested that there was any other consideration that had informed this decision. Meanwhile, women prisoners in analogous circumstances, that is to say, convicted of the same crimes, given the same sentence, having served the same proportion of the sentence, and having progressed to the medium-security level, would have been eligible for such prison leave.",
          "89": "89.\u00a0\u00a0In justifying this distinction the Government argued that women prisoners, in general, were less violent and less prone to aggression towards other inmates or prison staff, whereas men prisoners were more predisposed to inter-prisoner violence and attempted prison-breaks and they posed higher threats to prison security and staff. The Government have not, however, submitted any data supporting this claim. In particular, the Court lacks information concerning the conduct of the relevant groups of prisoners, namely, men and women convicted of serious or especially serious crimes, with regard to the compliance with prison regime and, even more importantly, their conduct when released on prison leave.",
          "90": "90.\u00a0\u00a0Be it as it may, the Court is not persuaded that even if this claim had been supported by data, it would be sufficient to justify this distinction. Finding otherwise would be tantamount to concluding that all male prisoners, when compared to women who have committed exactly the same offences, are so much more dangerous that no individualised assessment is even purposeful. Such an approach would be incompatible with the case-law of the Court emphasising the need for an individualised risk assessment of all detainees with regard to prison leave (see paragraph 91 below). The Court also refers here to CPT\u2019s repeated criticism of the Latvian \u201cprogressive sentence execution\u201d system under which all prisoners are required to spend a predetermined minimum amount of time at both the maximum- and the medium-security level since it is the prison authorities who should be responsible for determining security and regime requirements, on the basis of professionally agreed criteria and individual assessments of prisoners (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above).",
          "91": "91.\u00a0\u00a0The Court fully shares the Government\u2019s proposition that there is no objective need to subject women prisoners to conditions that are stricter than necessary. It emphasises, however, that this principle is equally applicable to male prisoners. The Court notes that while Article 8 of the Convention does not guarantee a detained person an unconditional right to leave prison in order to attend the funeral of a relative, the domestic authorities are called upon to assess each such request on its merits (see Giszczak, cited above, \u00a7 36, and P\u0142oski, cited above, \u00a7 38). The Court has found a violation of that Article where the domestic authorities had failed to carry out a balancing exercise between the competing interests or had based their refusal solely on the grounds that the domestic law did not provide for such a right (see Cs\u00e1szy v. Hungary, no.\u00a014447/11, \u00a7 20, 21\u00a0October 2014, and Feldman v. Ukraine (no. 2), no.\u00a042921/09, \u00a7 35, 12\u00a0January 2012).",
          "92": "92.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Court emphasises that, although there may be several legitimate penological grounds for a person\u2019s detention, the emphasis in European penal policy is now on the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment (see Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 115, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). While this principle applies regardless of the crime committed or the duration of the sentence imposed (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 111-18), it also applies irrespective of the prisoner\u2019s sex. The Court underlines that maintenance of family ties is an essential means of aiding social reintegration and rehabilitation of all prisoners, regardless of their sex (compare Khoroshenko, cited above, \u00a7 144). Furthermore, also prison leave is one of the means of facilitating social reintegration of all prisoners (see Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, \u00a7 72, ECHR 2002VIII, and Schemkamper, cited above, \u00a7\u00a031).",
          "93": "93.\u00a0\u00a0In the light of that, and not discounting a possibility that certain divergences in the approaches towards male and female prisoners may be justified, the Court does not consider that a blanket ban for men to leave the prison, even for attending a funeral of a family member, was conducive to the goal of ensuring that the distinctive needs of women prisoners are taken into account.",
          "94": "94.\u00a0\u00a0Having found that the refusal to entertain the applicant\u2019s request to attend his father\u2019s funeral on the basis of the prison regime to which he was subjected owing to his sex had no objective and reasonable justification, the Court concludes that this treatment was discriminatory.",
          "95": "95.\u00a0\u00a0There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention."

The latter refusal was not based on the assessment of his individual situation, in particular the fact that he had not been given an opportunity to see his mother before her death. The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. It is typical for funerals to be fixed at very short notice and they are generally regarded as a matter of urgency. In this case, it would have been physically possible for the first applicant to arrive at the funeral, which was held on the following day in the same city. The fact that the request came from the Ombudsperson rather than from the applicant should not have mattered because it was clear from her letter that the request had been initiated by the applicant\u2019s counsel (see paragraph 144 above). In the Court\u2019s view, the decision to refuse the first applicant leave was taken in a manner incompatible with the State\u2019s duty to carry out an individualised evaluation of his particular situation and to demonstrate that the restriction of his right to attend a relative\u2019s funeral was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d."

While the Convention does not explicitly mention funerals, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has found that the right to respect for private and family life includes the right to participate in the funeral of a deceased person.\n\nThe ECtHR has found a violation of Article 8 in cases where the authorities denied the applicant's request to attend a funeral. However, the Court has also emphasized that the State's interference with the right to attend a funeral must be justified by a pressing social need and necessary in a democratic society.\n\nIn the case of Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark (1976), the ECtHR held that the refusal by Danish authorities to grant access to the funeral of a person who had been legally sterilized without their consent constituted a violation of Article 8. The Court found that the denial of access to the funeral interfered with the applicants' right to respect for their family life.\n\nIn the case of Savage v. United Kingdom (2008), the ECtHR found that the refusal by prison authorities to grant a prisoner access to his father's funeral did not violate Article 8. The Court noted that the applicant's access to the funeral was refused based on prison regulations and that the applicant was allowed to attend the funeral by video link. The Court also considered that the applicant could have made alternative arrangements to attend the funeral if not for the imprisonment.\n\nTherefore, the ECtHR will consider the specific circumstances of each case when determining whether a violation of Article 8 has occurred due to the denial of attending a funeral. Factors that may be relevant include the reasons for the denial, the applicant's relationship with the deceased, and the availability of alternative means to participate in the funeral.",

In the case of P\u0142oski v. Poland (no.\u00a026761/95, \u00a7 32, 12 November 2002) a refusal to allow the applicant, a prisoner, to attend the funeral of his close relatives was found to constitute an interference with the right to respect for his private and family life. In the case of Elli Poluhas D\u00f6dsbo v. Sweden (no.\u00a061564/00, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2006I) the Court found that the refusal to transfer an urn containing the ashes of the applicant\u2019s husband could also be seen as falling within the ambit of Article\u00a08, without however stating whether the interference found related to the concept of private life or family life. In the case of HadriVionnet (cited above, \u00a7 52) the Court decided that the possibility for the applicant to be present at the funeral of her stillborn child, along with the related transfer and ceremonial arrangements, was also capable of falling within the ambit of Article 8. In the case of Sabanchiyeva and Others v. Russia (no.\u00a038450/05, \u00a7 122-23, ECHR 2013 (extracts)) the Court accepted that the refusal to return the bodies of the applicants\u2019 relatives, alleged terrorists, and their burial in an unspecified location had amounted to interference with the relatives\u2019 \u201cprivate life\u201d and \u201cfamily life\u201d. In the cases of Petrova v.\u00a0Latvia (no. 4605/05, \u00a7 77, 24 June 2014) and Elberte (cited above, \u00a7 89) the Court recognised that the removal of a deceased relative\u2019s organs or tissues without consent came within the scope of the \u201cprivate life\u201d of the surviving family members. In the case of Lozovyye v. Russia (no. 4587/09, \u00a7\u00a034, 24\u00a0April 2018) the Court held that the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private and family life had been affected by the failure of the State to inform them of their son\u2019s death before he had been buried."

                "paragraph_text": "CASE OF M.A. v. DENMARK; \u00a7 22: . On appeal, by a judgment of 6 November 2017, the Supreme Court ( H\u00f8jesteret ) also found against him. Sitting as a panel of seven judges, it stated as follows: \u201cThe case involves judicial review of the decision made by the Immigration Appeals Board on 16 September 2016, in which the application for residence in Denmark for [G.M.], the spouse of [M.A.], was rejected. [G.M.] had applied for a residence permit based on her marriage to [M.A.], who had been granted residence in Denmark under section 7(3) of the Aliens Act (temporary protection status due to the general situation in Syria, his country of origin). The reason for the decision is that [M.A.] had not yet had his residence permit issued under section 7(3) of the Aliens Act for at least the last three years, see section 9(1)(i)(d), and that there were no exceptional reasons, including regard for family unity, for issuing a residence permit under section 9c(1) of the Aliens Act. [M.A.] has submitted that the refusal of his application for family reunification was contrary to Article 8 read alone and to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights read in conjunction with Article 8, when the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board was made, or at least the refusal is contrary to the Convention at the present time. The Supreme Court notes in this respect that a judicial review of the Immigration Appeals Board\u2019s decision under section 63 of the Danish Constitution ( grundloven ) must be based on the circumstances existing at the time when the decision was made, see, inter alia , the Supreme Court decision reproduced on p. 639 of the Weekly Law Reports for 2006 (UfR 2006.639 H). The issue of the right to respect for family life under Article 8 ... According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, any State is entitled to control immigration into its territory provided that the State complies with its international obligations. Article 8 does not imply a general obligation on the part of a State to respect immigrants\u2019 choice of their country of residence or to grant them the right to family reunification on its territory. In a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State\u2019s obligations will vary according to the particular circumstances of the person involved and the general interest, see, for example, paras 43 and 44 of the judgment delivered by the Court of Human Rights on 10 July 2014 in Mugenzi v. France . The decision in the case at hand was made in accordance with the provision that persons who are not recognised as refugees according to the UN Refugee Convention, but who cannot return because they risk ill-treatment falling within Article 3 of the Convention on Human Rights because of the general conditions in their country of origin, must normally have held a residence permit for three years before they become eligible for family reunification. A number of other signatory countries to the Convention on Human Rights also have rules stipulating that persons who are granted protection status without being UN Convention refugees can only be granted family reunification after the expiry of a certain period. The European Court of Human Rights has not yet considered to what extent such statutory waiting periods applicable to persons who are granted protection status without being UN Convention refugees are compatible with Article 8. The Court said in its judgments of 10 July 2014 in Tanda-Muzinga v. France and Mugenzi v. France that refugees need to benefit from a family reunification procedure that is more favourable than that foreseen for other aliens and that such applications must be examined promptly, attentively and with particular diligence. The applicants in the above two cases were not persons granted temporary protection status, but refugees recognised under the UN Refugee Convention. As a matter of fact, the cases did not concern a statutory waiting period as in the case at hand, but situations in which the visa application examination procedure had been unreasonably lengthy. The Court of Human Rights found in its judgment of the same date (10 July 2014) in Senigo Longue and Others v. France that Article 8 had been violated in a situation in which the French authorities had, in connection with the examination of an application for family reunification, doubted the applicant\u2019s maternal relationship with two children who had been left alone in Cameroon and had taken four years to reach a decision. In that case, the Court said that, despite the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State, the decision-making process did not sufficiently safeguard the flexibility, speed and efficiency required to observe the right to respect for family life. The applicant in that case was not a refugee, but had come to France as a result of family reunification with her spouse. The case did not concern the period of 18 months that she had to wait under French law before being able to apply for family reunification, but only the long processing time after the application had been lodged. It follows from the ... Court\u2019s case-law that the factors to be taken into account when determining whether a State is obliged to grant family reunification are the extent to which family life is effectively ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of one or more of them and whether there are factors of immigration control or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion, see, inter alia , \u00a7 70 of the judgment delivered on 28 September 2011 in Nunez v. Norway . It appears from the preparatory notes of section 7(3) and section 9(1)(i)(d) of the Aliens Act that the separate treatment of this group of people whose need for protection is based on the general situation in their country of origin (temporary protection status under section 7(3) and the limited right to family reunification afforded to this group were introduced in the light of the conflict in Syria, which has caused millions of people to flee and has led to a significant increase in the number of new asylum-seekers in Denmark. It also appears from the preparatory notes that the Government is ready to assume joint responsibility and safeguard the protection of this group of asylum-seekers for as long as they need protection, but that Denmark is not to accept so many refugees that it will threaten national cohesion. Moreover, it appears that the number of newcomers determines whether the subsequent integration becomes successful and that it is necessary to strike the right balance to maintain a good and safe society. Against this background, the Supreme Court finds that the restriction on the eligibility for family reunification is justified by interests to be safeguarded under Article 8 of the Convention. The question is now whether the restriction is necessary in a democratic society in order to safeguard the said interests. The Supreme Court finds that the situation of [M.A.] is not comparable with the situations considered by the European Court in Tanda-Muzinga v. France , Mugenzi v. France and Senigo Longue and Others v. France . The first two cases concerned UN Convention refugees, and all three cases concerned long processing times. The assessment of whether the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board to refuse family reunification is compatible with Article 8 must therefore be based on the general criteria listed by the European Court of Human Rights, see Nunez v. Norway (cited above). [M.A.] had held a residence permit for Denmark for about one year and three months when the application was refused by the Immigration Appeals Board. Accordingly, he had limited ties in Denmark, and [G.M.], his spouse, has no ties in Denmark. The Supreme Court accepts as a fact that the couple face insurmountable obstacles to cohabiting in Syria because [M.A.] risks ill-treatment falling within Article 3 if returned to Syria due to the particularly serious situation characterised by arbitrary violence and ill-treatment of civilians. In reality, the refusal of the application for family reunification therefore implies that he is prevented from cohabiting with his spouse, although the barrier to his right to exercise his family life is only temporary. It follows from the decision of the Refugee Appeals Board of 9 December 2015 that [M.A.] has not placed himself in an adversarial position to the Syrian authorities or to the opposition of the regime due to his specific and personal circumstances so that he risks persecution or ill-treatment falling within section 7(1) or section 7(2) of the Aliens Act and that he has not caught the attention of the Syrian authorities or others in such manner as to fall within those provisions. Therefore, he can return to Syria when the general situation in the country improves. If there is no such improvement within three years from the date on which [M.A.] was granted residence in Denmark, he will normally be eligible for family reunification with his spouse. An application to this effect can be lodged two months prior to expiry of the three-year period, and the Supreme Court accepts as a fact that, in that case, the application will be examined as set out in the preparatory notes of the Act as quickly as possible when he has resided in Denmark for three years and a decision has been made to renew his temporary residence permit under section 7(3). Should exceptional circumstances emerge before the expiry of the three-year period, such as serious illness, which will make the separation from his spouse particularly severe, it will be possible to be granted family reunification under section 9c(1) of the Aliens Act. Against this background, the Supreme Court finds that the condition that [M.A.] must normally have been resident in Denmark for three years before he can be granted family reunification with his spouse falls within the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State when balancing the regard for the respect for his family life and the regard for the interests of society, which can be safeguarded according to Article 8. The Supreme Court finds that the decrease in the number of asylum-seekers in 2016 and 2017 cannot result in a different outcome of the assessment of whether the decision made by the Immigration Appeals Board in the case of [M.A.] was justified. The Supreme Court observes in this respect that it was decided by Law no. 153 of 18 February 2015 [the 2015 Act], which introduced the one-year residence permit requirement as a condition for the right to family reunification, that a review of the Aliens Act should be introduced in the Parliamentary year 2017/18 at the latest. By Law no. 102 of 3 February 2016 [the 2016 Act], which amended the three-year residence permit requirement, this review clause was maintained. The reason for this amendment given in the preparatory notes is that the Government found that the extraordinary situation with a very large number of asylum-seekers and applications for family reunification in Denmark had made it necessary to tighten rules as proposed. The Supreme Court therefore concurs in the view that the decision made by the Immigration Appeals Board is not contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The issue of differential treatment under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights read in conjunction with Article 8 The requirement of three years\u2019 residence as a condition for family reunification applies to persons like [M.A.] issued with a residence permit under section 7(3) of the Aliens Act who risk ill-treatment falling within Article 3 of the Convention on Human Rights if returned to their country of origin because the situation in the country of origin is generally characterised by arbitrary violence against civilians. As opposed to those situations, the three-year residence requirement does not apply to aliens issued with a residence permit under section 7(1), because they fall within the Refugee Convention, or under section 7(2), because they risk ill-treatment falling within Article 3 if returned to their country of origin due to their personal circumstances. Article 14 of the Convention ... prohibits differential treatment based on the rights protected by the Convention, such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, etc. or \u2018other status\u2019. [M.A.] had not experienced differential treatment based on sex, race or any other status as expressly listed in Article 14 by the date of the decision made by the Immigration Appeals Board. However, it appears from the ... Court\u2019s case-law that a person\u2019s immigration status can be any \u2018other status\u2019 falling within Article 14, see \u00a7 45 of the judgment of 27 September 2011 in Bah v. the United Kingdom and \u00a7\u00a7 44 to 47 of the judgment of 6 November 2012 in Hode and Abdi v. the United Kingdom . It further appears that differential treatment contrary to Article 14 occurs if persons in similar or comparable situations are afforded a more favourable treatment in terms of the rights protected by the Convention and such differential treatment is not based on objective and fair reasons, that is, if the differential treatment is disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. Finally, it appears that the Contracting States enjoy a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment and that the scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and the background. According to the preparatory notes to section 9(1)(i)(d) of the Aliens Act, the different rules on family reunification applicable to aliens granted residence under section 7(1) and (2) and aliens like [M.A.] who are granted residence under section 7(3) are justified by the circumstance that aliens granted residence under section 7(1) and (2) are subjected to personal persecution, usually because of a conflict with the authorities or others in their country of origin, whereas aliens granted residence under section 7(3) are not subject to personal persecution but have fled due to the general situation, such as war, in their country of origin. Those individuals therefore do not have a specific conflict with anybody in their country of origin, and the preparatory notes considered it a fact that, in general, this group of individuals have a more temporary need for protection than persons subjected to personal persecution as the situation in their country of origin may quickly change in nature and become more peaceful. The Supreme Court considers it doubtful whether the situation of [M.A.] is comparable with the situation of aliens granted residence under section 7(1) and (2) of the Aliens Act because they risk persecution due to their personal circumstances if returned to their country of origin. Despite this assumption, the Supreme Court finds that the difference in the right to family reunification, which is, as already mentioned, based on an assessment of the need for protection among different groups of individuals, must be deemed to have been based on objective and fair reasons falling within the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in a case concerning differential treatment based on immigration status. Accordingly, the Supreme Court finds no basis for dismissing the assessment made by the Danish Parliament, according to which, from a general perspective, the need for protection of persons falling within section 7(3) of the Aliens Act is more temporary than that of persons falling within section 7(1) and (2). The general situation in a person\u2019s country of origin, which has justified a temporary need for protection, may quickly change. This is illustrated by the judgments delivered by the Court of Human Rights on 28 June 2011 in Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom and on 5 September 2013 in K.A.B. v. Sweden . In assessing whether the restriction on the right of [M.A.] to be granted family reunification in Denmark with his spouse is compatible with Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 8, the Supreme Court has also emphasised that his separation from his spouse, as mentioned in the above paragraph on Article 8, is only temporary and that he can be granted family reunification at a later point if exceptional reasons apply. Against this background, the Supreme Court concurs with the view that the decision made by the Immigration Appeals Board is not contrary to Article 14 of the Convention ... taken together with Article 8, either.\u201d"

The latter refusal was not based on the assessment of his individual situation, in particular the fact that he had not been given an opportunity to see his mother before her death. The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it.

    "answer": "In establishing the constituent elements of defamation, the Court requires that there be an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in defamation. In the Reznik v. Russia judgment, concerning a defamation claim against the President of the Moscow City Bar, the Court emphasised that mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism. The Court held that the domestic authorities had failed to adduce sufficient reasons for establishing an objective link between the statement in question and the claimants in the defamation action (\u00a7 45; see also Margulev v. Russia, \u00a7 53). In certain cases, a small group of persons, such as the board of directors of a company or organisation, can also bring a defamation action where the target is the group, but where its members, even if not mentioned by name, can be identified by the persons who know them or, more generally, by a \u201creasonable person\u201d.",

Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism. Those principles also apply in the sphere of television and radio broadcasting (see Godlevskiy, cited above, \u00a7 44; Filatenko, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Dyuldin and Kislov v. Russia, no.\u00a025968/02, \u00a7 44, 31 July 2007). It is an uncontested fact in the instant case that neither the individual plaintiffs \u2013 two prison warders \u2013 nor the suing legal entity \u2013 a  remand centre \u2013 had been named in the applicant\u2019s speech. The City Court accepted, nevertheless, that all of them were entitled to sue in defamation because the applicant\u2019s intervention had been preceded by some footage showing the remand centre building. The Government also added that the prison warders had been identifiable because their names had been publicised by other media. Those reasons do not appear sufficient to the Court. The discussion was broadcast live and the applicant could not have been aware of any footage that the editor had chosen to use as an introduction to the debate. The Government\u2019s contention that the names of Mr B. and Mr F. had entered the public domain was not substantiated with any material from the printed or visual media, whereas the applicant produced a selection of newspaper articles, all of which referred to them as \u201cprison officers\u201d, without giving their name or rank. In any event, the extent of the applicant\u2019s liability in defamation must not go beyond his own words and he may not be held responsible for statements or allegations made by others, be it a television editor or journalists. The fact remains that there was nothing in the applicant\u2019s statement to permit identification of the plaintiffs whom he described impersonally as \u201cmen\u201d, without mentioning their names or employer. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to adduce sufficient reasons for establishing an objective link between the statement in question and the individual claimants in the defamation action."

          "53": "53.\u00a0\u00a0As to the need to perform a balancing exercise between the right to reputation and freedom of expression, the Court points out that the claimant in the defamation proceedings, Moscow City Council, is the executive body of the city of Moscow, a constituent entity of the Russian Federation. The Court reiterates that limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of a body vested with executive powers must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see, mutatis mutandis, \u015eener v. Turkey, no. 26680/95, \u00a7\u00a040, 18 July 2000, and Lombardo and Others, cited above, \u00a7 54). As the executive authority of a federal constituent entity, Moscow City Council should be expected to display a high degree of tolerance to criticism. Nevertheless, not only did the domestic courts fail to consider the position of the claimant as a public authority in the context of the defamation proceedings against the newspaper\u2019s editorial board, they expressly rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that Moscow City Council had not even been named in the impugned statements (see paragraph 12 above). The Court points out in this connection that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the party suing in defamation is a requisite element (see, mutatis mutandis, Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, \u00a7\u00a044, 14 October 2008, and Kunitsyna, cited above, \u00a7 42). The District Court\u2019s reasoning, endorsed by the City Court, appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of reputation prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, \u00a7 69). By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise (see Skudayeva, cited above, \u00a7 38)."

The statement must directly concern the person suing or affect their rights: The statement must refer to facts or circumstances related to the person suing or affect their legal status, interests, or activities.\n\n4. The person suing must have a legitimate interest in bringing the defamation action: The person suing must demonstrate that they have a legitimate interest in restoring their reputation or protecting their honor and dignity.

RUSSIA; \u00a7 42: In this connection, the Court reiterates that the right to protection of one\u2019s reputation is covered by Article 8 of the Convention as part of the right to respect for private life (see Chauvy and Others v. France, no.\u00a064915/01, \u00a7\u00a070, ECHR 2004-VI; Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, \u00a7 35, 15\u00a0November 2007; Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v.

For Article 8 to come into play, an attack on a person\u2019s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life\u201d (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no.\u00a039954/08, \u00a7 83, 7\u00a0February 2012). The Court further reiterates that, for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in defamation is a requisite element. Mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person in question was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant, or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Reznik v.\u00a0Russia, no. 4977/05, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2013, and the authorities cited therein)."

As noted above, the applicant\u2019s publication did not mention any of the plaintiffs in the defamation action by name or an otherwise identifiable manner. The article collectively referred to \u201cthe police\u201d, \u201cthe anti-narcotics unit\u201d or employed the non-specific third-person pronoun \u201cthey\u201d (see, in particular, Ms V.\u2019s interview in paragraph 8 above). The District Court devoted a considerable part of its judgment to statements by the plaintiffs and their relatives who had felt hurt by the publication and claimed to be affected by it. The Court reiterates, however, that mere personal conjecture or subjective perception of a publication as defamatory does not suffice to establish that the person was directly affected by the publication. There must be something in the circumstances of a particular case to make the ordinary reader feel that the statement reflected directly on the individual claimant or that he was targeted by the criticism (see Dyuldin and Kislov\u00a0v. , no.\u00a025968/02, \u00a7\u00a044, 31\u00a0July 2007). The District Court\u2019s judgment was founded solely on the subjective perception of the publication by the plaintiffs and their relatives, without discussion of whether the decision to accept the standing of non-identified individuals to sue in defamation was objectively and reasonably justified. Furthermore, the District Court failed to operate a distinction between the situation of the officers against whom criminal charges had been levelled and that of those officers who were not subject to any criminal proceedings. The issue of standing was explicitly raised in the statement of appeal. Nevertheless, the  considered the District Court\u2019s failure to verify the plaintiffs\u2019 standing to sue in defamation to have been a formal defect which did not invalidate the otherwise correct judgment (see paragraph 18 above). The Court finds that, in the circumstances of the case, the issue of standing was of primordial importance and that the domestic courts did not identify a pressing social need for putting the protection of the plaintiffs\u2019 personality rights above the applicant\u2019s right to freedom of expression."

The statement must refer to the person suing: The impugned statement must explicitly or implicitly identify the person bringing the defamation action as the one being defamed.\n\n2. The statement must be capable of harming the reputation of the person suing: The statement must have the potential to cause harm to the reputation of the person suing, even if it is not the primary target of the defamatory statement. This assessment is based on the content, context, and circumstances of the statement.\n\n3. The statement must directly concern the person suing or affect their rights: The statement must refer to facts or circumstances related to the person suing or affect their legal status, interests, or activities.\n\n4. The person suing must have a legitimate interest in bringing the defamation action: The person suing must demonstrate that they have a legitimate interest in restoring their reputation or protecting their honor and dignity. This interest is not absolute, and the ECtHR will consider the context and circumstances of the case when making this assessment.\n\n5. The person suing must not be using the defamation action as a means to suppress or hide information: The person suing cannot use the defamation action to censor or suppress legitimate speech, nor can they abuse the legal process to shield themselves from criticism or scrutiny.\n\n6. The interest in freedom of expression must be balanced against the person suing's reputation rights: The ECtHR will weigh the right to freedom of expression against the person suing's right to reputation. This balance will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the importance of the issues at stake.\n\nOverall, the ECtHR will consider the entire context and circumstances of the case when determining whether there is an objective link between the impugned statement and the person suing in a defamation case.",

    "answer": "Similarly, Article 6 \u00a7 2 applies where two sets of criminal proceedings are in parallel pending against the applicant. In such cases, the presumption of innocence precludes a finding of guilt for a particular offence outside the criminal proceedings before the competent trial court, irrespective of the procedural safeguards in the parallel proceedings and notwithstanding general considerations of expediency. The presumption of innocence also protects individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence with which they have been charged. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public (Allen v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2013, \u00a7 94).",

Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuation decision in any other proceedings, the fair-trial guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person\u2019s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public.

For instance, pre-trial detention orders, which may be based on reasonable suspicion of involvement in a criminal offence, do not violate the presumption of innocence, as they are only provisional measures to ensure the effective conduct of criminal proceedings and the prevention of flight or interference with evidence.\n\nAs for finding guilt for a particular offence outside the criminal proceedings, this may raise concerns regarding the individual's reputation and perception by the public. A finding of guilt, even before trial, can have serious consequences, including social stigma, lost employment opportunities, and public humiliation. In the context of media reporting, a bias towards publishing accusations or allegations, even if they are unproven or baseless, may harm an individual's reputation and undermine the presumption of innocence.\n\nIn order to balance the protection of the presumption of innocence and the need to protect the individual's reputation and perception, several measures can be taken. For instance, there are legal frameworks in place for defamation and libel, wherein the burden is on the accused to prove that the published information is true or protected by privilege. Criminal courts may also sanction media outlets for inaccurate reporting or invasive journalism.\n\nAdditionally, there is growing recognition of the importance of protecting the presumption of innocence in the context of social media and online platforms. International human rights bodies have emphasized the need to regulate the spread of false or defamatory information online and to ensure that individuals have effective remedies to clear their names.\n\nOverall, the presumption of innocence is a cornerstone of fair trial and criminal justice. Although there may be some limited circumstances where its application may be challenged or overcome before the trial, it is crucial that the individual's reputation and perception are not unduly harmed by findings of guilt or public accusations. Measures that strengthen the protection of the presumption of innocence, both within and outside the criminal proceedings, are essential in ensuring that the fundamental human rights of individuals are upheld.",

Her only motivation for doing so had been to protect her own interests in the public debate with the mayor of the municipality, which had been the company\u2019s sole shareholder. In his media statements M.U. had criticised the applicant only for unsound business decisions rather than for any unlawfulness in doing business, meaning she had not needed to defend herself. The applicant had indisputably had the right to publicly deny media allegations which harmed her reputation, or institute the relevant proceedings, or do both of those things. However, in response to M.U.\u2019s criticism the applicant had picked as her \u201cweapon of choice\u201d in the public debate the alleged unlawful charging for parking, which she had also mentioned as being of interest to the prosecuting authorities. That was how she had involved the company of which she had been the director in her media debate with the mayor, causing harm to its business reputation. That was also why she had been dismissed from her job, a measure which, albeit severe, had not been disproportionate in the circumstances and which had therefore been \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, it being understood that no employer should tolerate being slandered in public by its employees."

The allegations cast M.S. in a very negative light and were liable to portray her as a person who was disrespectful and contemptuous in her opinions and sentiments about Muslims and ethnic Bosniacs. The domestic courts held that the statements in question contained defamatory accusations that damaged M.S.\u2019s reputation (see paragraph 28 above). The Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. On the contrary, the nature of the accusations was such as to seriously call into question M.S. suitability not only for the post of director of the BD radio for which she had applied, but also for her role as editor of the BD\u2019s radio entertainment programme in a multi-ethnic public radio station."

Under its first aspect, the principle of presumption of innocence prohibits public officials from making premature statements about the defendant\u2019s guilt and acts as a procedural guarantee to ensure the fairness of the criminal trial itself. However, it is not limited to a procedural safeguard in criminal matters: its scope is broader and requires that no representative of the State should say that a person is guilty of an offence before his guilt has been established by a court (Konstas v.\u00a0Greece, no. 53466/07, \u00a7 32, 24 May 2011).

A finding of guilt, even before trial, can have serious consequences, including social stigma, lost employment opportunities, and public humiliation.

UKRAINE; \u00a7 44: In its case-law the Court has emphasised the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained at that stage provides the framework for consideration of the offence at the trial. At the same time, an accused person often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure has tended to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular situation of vulnerability can only properly be compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure that the right of an accused not to incriminate himself is respected. Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination. In this connection, the Court has noted that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly important in the case of serious charges (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no.\u00a036391/02, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2008, with further references)."

As a consequence, a trial judge faced with a challenge to the fairness of proceedings based on adverse publicity is able to take a variety of steps during the trial process, within an established and adequate legal framework which provides appropriate guidance, aimed at securing the fairness of the trial. The question in the present case is whether the steps taken by the trial judge were sufficient in all the circumstances of the case."

    "answer": "Accordingly, the authorities enjoyed a wider margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take in order to protect individuals\u2019 possessions from weather hazards than in deciding on the measures needed to protect lives. In Budayeva and Others v. Russia, 2008, \u00a7 137, where mudslides had caused the deaths of several persons, the Court pointed out that the aforementioned principles were applicable in the sphere of emergency relief, where the State is directly involved in the protection of human lives through the mitigation of natural hazards, in so far as the circumstances of a particular case pointed to the imminence of a natural hazard that had been clearly identifiable, and especially where it concerned a recurring calamity affecting a distinct area developed for human habitation or use. The scope of the positive obligations imputable to the State in the particular circumstances would depend on the origin of the threat and the extent to which one or the other risk is susceptible to mitigation. The Court particularly emphasised the scope of the State\u2019s margin of appreciation in the sphere of emergency relief in relation to a meteorological event. Since such events are beyond human control, the argument that an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities regardless of the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources takes on even greater weight than in the sphere of dangerous activities of a man-made nature (Budayeva and Others v. Russia, 2008, \u00a7 135).",

        "answer": "Under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the State has a positive obligation to protect the life of its citizens. This obligation extends to taking reasonable measures to mitigate natural hazards that pose a foreseeable risk to human life. In cases relating to the mitigation of natural hazards, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has established certain criteria to determine the scope of the positive obligations imputable to the State.\n\nFirstly, the Court will examine the imminence and clear identifiability of the hazard. If the hazard is imminent, meaning that there is an impending threat of harm, and clearly identifiable, meaning that the State was or ought to have been aware of the risk, then the State may have a greater duty to take action to mitigate the risk.\n\nSecondly, the Court will consider the extent of the impact of the hazard on a distinct area developed for human habitation or use. The more significant the impact on human life and property, the stronger the State's obligation to take measures to mitigate the risk.\n\nThirdly, the Court will take into account the State's margin of appreciation in the sphere of emergency relief. This means that the State has some degree of discretion in deciding how to respond to a natural hazard. The ECtHR recognizes that there may be a variety of legitimate ways to address the risk, and the State's choices will not necessarily be subject to scrutiny as long as they are not manifestly arbitrary or disproportionate.\n\nTherefore, when determining the scope of the positive obligations imputable to the State under Article 2 in cases involving the mitigation of natural hazards, the ECtHR will consider the imminence and clear identifiability of the hazard, its impact on human life and property, and the State's margin of appreciation in the sphere of emergency relief. The Court will examine whether the State has taken reasonable measures to mitigate the risk and will assess the proportionality of those measures in the circumstances.",

RUSSIA; \u00a7 62: The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The Court has already noted that the scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be \u201ceffective\u201d in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy, cited above, \u00a7\u00a095, and Mente\u015f and Others v. Turkey, 28 November 1997, \u00a7 89, Reports 1997VIII). The Court further considers that, where an arguable breach of one or more of the rights under the Convention is in issue, there should be available to the victim a mechanism for establishing any liability of State officials or bodies for that breach (see T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, \u00a7 107, ECHR 2001V (extracts)). Furthermore, in the case of a breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage flowing from the breach should in principle be available as part of the range of redress (see Z and Others v. the  [GC], no. 29392/95, \u00a7\u00a0109, ECHR 2001V)."

While the fundamental importance of the right to life requires that the scope of the positive obligations under Article\u00a02 includes a duty to do everything within the authorities' power in the sphere of disaster relief for the protection of that right, the obligation to protect the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, which is not absolute, cannot extend further than what is reasonable in the circumstances. Accordingly, the authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take in order to protect individuals' possessions from weather hazards than in deciding on the measures needed to protect lives."

    "answer": "A mere mistake or irregularity in the electoral process, and in particular at the more technical stages of it, would not, per se, signify unfairness of the elections, if the general principles of equality, transparency, impartiality and independence of the electoral administration were complied with. The effectiveness of the right to stand for election is undoubtedly contingent upon the fair exercise of the right to vote. Tighter scrutiny should be reserved for any departures from the principle of universal suffrage, but a broader margin of appreciation could be afforded to States where the measures prevented candidates from standing for elections. A still less stringent scrutiny would apply to the more technical stage of vote counting and tabulation (Davydov and Others v. Russia, 2017, \u00a7\u00a7 283- 288).",

          "283": "283.\u00a0\u00a0The Court observes that the Venice Commission Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters devotes significant attention to the process of counting, transfer and tabulation of results, insisting that this process must be transparent and open, and that observers and candidates\u2019 representatives must be allowed to be present and to obtain copies of the records drawn up (see section I.3.2 of the Code, paragraph 196 above). In the same vein, the Explanatory Report to the Code contains some additional recommendations applicable to the process of counting, recording of results and their transfer to the higher authority (see Explanatory Report, sections I.3.2.2.4. (Counting) and I.3.2.2.5. (Transferring the results), paragraph 196 above). The Report suggests that observers, media and others authorised to be present at the polling station should be allowed to be present during the count, and that there should be \u201cenough copies of the record of the proceedings to ensure that all the aforementioned persons receive one\u201d. Furthermore, transmission of the results \u2013 \u201ca vital operation whose importance is often overlooked\u201d \u2013 should also be carried out in an open and controlled manner, where the person transmitting the results, usually the presiding officer of the polling station, should be accompanied by other members of the polling station representing opposition parties, if necessary under additional security (ibid.).",
          "284": "284.\u00a0\u00a0These detailed recommendations reflect the importance of technical details, which can be crucial in ensuring an open and transparent procedure of ascertaining the voters\u2019 will through the counting of ballot papers and the accurate recording of election results throughout the system, from the local polling station to the Central Electoral Commission. They confirm that, in the eyes of the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters, the post-voting stages covering counting, recording and transfer of the election results form an indispensable part of the election process. As such, they should be accompanied by clear procedural guarantees, be open and transparent, and allow observation by members across the whole political spectrum, including the opposition, in order to ensure the realisation of the principle of the voters\u2019 freedom to express their will and the need to combat electoral fraud.",
          "285": "285.\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 to the Convention was not conceived as a code on electoral matters designed to regulate all aspects of the electoral process (see Communist Party of Russia and Others v. Russia, no.\u00a029400/05, \u00a7 108, 19 June 2012). However, the Court has already confirmed that the common principles of the European constitutional heritage, which form the basis of any genuinely democratic society, enshrine within themselves the right to vote in terms of the opportunity to cast a vote in universal, equal, free, secret and direct elections held at regular intervals (see the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters, paragraph 196 above). Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention explicitly provides for the right to free elections at regular intervals by secret ballot, and other principles have also been recognised in the Convention institutions\u2019 case-law (see Russian Conservative Party of Entrepreneurs and Others, cited above, \u00a7 70). In this setting, free elections are to be seen as both an individual right and a positive obligation of the State, comprising a number of guarantees starting from the right of the voters to form an opinion freely, and extending to careful regulation of the process in which the results of voting are ascertained, processed and recorded.",
          "286": "286.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, the Court reiterates that the level of its own scrutiny will depend on the particular aspect of the right to free elections. Thus, tighter scrutiny should be reserved for any departures from the principle of universal suffrage (see Hirst (no.\u00a02), cited above, \u00a7 62). A broader margin of appreciation can be afforded to States where the measures prevent candidates from standing for election, but such interference should not be disproportionate (see Krasnov and Skuratov v. Russia, nos.\u00a017864/04 and 21396/04, \u00a7 65, 19\u00a0July 2007, and Russian Conservative Party of Entrepreneurs and Others, cited above, \u00a7 65).",
          "287": "287.\u00a0\u00a0A still less stringent scrutiny would apply to the more technical stage of vote counting and tabulation. Due regard must be had to the fact that this is a complex process, with many persons involved at several levels. A mere mistake or irregularity at this stage would not, per se, signify unfairness of the elections, if the general principles of equality, transparency, impartiality and independence of the electoral administration were complied with. The concept of free elections would be put at risk only if there was evidence of procedural breaches that would be capable of thwarting the free expression of the opinion of the people, for instance through gross distortion of the voters\u2019 intent; and where such complaints received no effective examination at the domestic level. Moreover, the Court should be cautious about conferring unrestricted standing to challenge this stage of elections on individual participants in the electoral process. This is especially so where the domestic legislation contains reasonable restrictions on individual voters\u2019 ability to challenge the results in their respective constituencies, such as the requirement for a quorum of voters (see section II.3.3 (f) of the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters, paragraph 196 above). Nevertheless, States should ensure such access to the appeal system as would be sufficient to make the guarantees under Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 effective throughout the electoral cycle. In the Russian context, the Constitutional Court ruling of 22\u00a0April 2013 confirmed the standing of individual voters to challenge the results in the constituencies where they had voted; subsequent legislative changes ensured such standing (see paragraph 188 above).",
          "288": "288.\u00a0\u00a0The Court therefore confirms that only serious irregularities in the process of counting and tabulation of votes that remained without an effective examination at the domestic level can constitute a breach of the individual right to free elections guaranteed under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, in both its active and its passive aspects. In line with its subsidiary role, the Court\u2019s task is limited to ensuring that the examination at domestic level afforded minimum procedural guarantees and that the findings of the domestic authorities were not arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Communist Party of Russia and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 116-17). It will proceed to analyse the applicants\u2019 complaints accordingly."

        "answer": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) acknowledges that there may be circumstances justifying a broader margin of appreciation for States when it comes to measures restricting candidates from standing for elections, as opposed to stricter scrutiny for departures from the principle of universal suffrage. This is because the right to stand for elections is not absolute and should be balanced against other important interests, such as preventing disorder or ensuring fair and free elections.\n\nThe ECtHR has identified several factors that may warrant a broader margin of appreciation for States:\n\n1. Complexities and uncertainties involved in electoral matters: Electoral systems can be intricate and complex, and the decision to exclude a candidate from standing in an election typically involves a degree of political judgment.\n2. Importance of maintaining public order and security: Measures restricting candidates from standing for elections may be necessary to prevent disorder, protect public security or ensure the proper functioning of the electoral process.\n3. Proximity of the matter to domestic politics: The ECtHR tends to give greater deference to national authorities in matters that are closely connected to domestic political considerations, including the organization and conduct of elections.\n\nRegarding the level of scrutiny to be applied to the more technical stage of vote counting and tabulation, the ECtHR has emphasized that in this context, domestic courts should enjoy a significant degree of discretion. This is because vote counting and tabulation involve complex and specialized tasks that require a significant level of expertise and factual knowledge.\n\nHowever, the ECtHR has also made it clear that, even in this area, there are minimum standards that must be met to ensure free and fair elections. These minimum standards include transparency, impartiality, and accountability in the electoral process, as well as the protection of the right to a fair trial in cases of alleged electoral fraud.\n\nIn conclusion, the ECtHR applies a case-by-case analysis to the question of when to apply a broader margin of appreciation to States in the context of candidate eligibility and when to apply tighter scrutiny for departures from the principle of universal suffrage. The level of scrutiny regarding the technical stage of vote counting and tabulation generally involves significant deference to domestic courts, with a focus on ensuring that minimum standards for free and fair elections are met.",

        "answer": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) acknowledges that there may be circumstances justifying a broader margin of appreciation for States when it comes to measures restricting candidates from standing for elections, as opposed to stricter scrutiny for departures from the principle of universal suffrage. This is because the right to stand for elections is not absolute and should be balanced against other important interests, such as preventing disorder or ensuring fair and free elections.\n\nThe ECtHR has identified several factors that may warrant a broader margin of appreciation for States:\n\n1. Complexities and uncertainties involved in electoral matters: Electoral systems can be intricate and complex, and the decision to exclude a candidate from standing in an election typically involves a degree of political judgment.\n2. Importance of maintaining public order and security: Measures restricting candidates from standing for elections may be necessary to prevent disorder, protect public security or ensure the proper functioning of the electoral process.\n3. Proximity of the matter to domestic politics: The ECtHR tends to give greater deference to national authorities in matters that are closely connected to domestic political considerations, including the organization and conduct of elections.\n\nRegarding the level of scrutiny to be applied to the more technical stage of vote counting and tabulation, the ECtHR has emphasized that in this context, domestic courts should enjoy a significant degree of discretion. This is because vote counting and tabulation involve complex and specialized tasks that require a significant level of expertise and factual knowledge.\n\nHowever, the ECtHR has also made it clear that, even in this area, there are minimum standards that must be met to ensure free and fair elections. These minimum standards include transparency, impartiality, and accountability in the electoral process, as well as the protection of the right to a fair trial in cases of alleged electoral fraud.\n\nIn conclusion, the ECtHR applies a case-by-case analysis to the question of when to apply a broader margin of appreciation to States in the context of candidate eligibility and when to apply tighter scrutiny for departures from the principle of universal suffrage. The level of scrutiny regarding the technical stage of vote counting and tabulation generally involves significant deference to domestic courts, with a focus on ensuring that minimum standards for free and fair elections are met.",

In cases such as the present one, which require the right to freedom of assembly to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression and, allegedly, against the right of others to freedom of assembly, the Court considers that the outcome of its scrutiny should not, in theory, vary according to whether the case has been lodged by a \u201cdemonstrator\u201d or a \u201ccounter-demonstrator\u201d. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities should in principle be the same in both cases. Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts as long as an overall, optimal balance between the competing rights has been achieved (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v.  (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0106-107, 7 February 2012). The Court\u2019s task is therefore to examine whether those authorities struck a fair balance between the interests of the protagonists. In order to do so, it is necessary to consider not only the general principles applicable to freedom of expression but also those applicable to freedom of assembly \u2013 which is of particular relevance for the determination of that balance."

RUSSIA; \u00a7 358: In any event, the analysis of the judicial decisions made in the present case reveals that, even in those cases where the Russian courts examined the question whether the refusal to approve the location, time or manner of conduct of a public event had been well reasoned, they failed to recognise that the cases involved a conflict between the right to freedom of assembly and other legitimate interests and to perform a balancing exercise. The balance appeared to be set in favour of protection of other interests, such as rights and freedoms of non-participants, in a way that made it difficult to turn the balance in favour of the freedom of assembly. The Court concludes that in practice Russian courts did not apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and did not apply the \u201cproportionality\u201d and \u201cnecessity\u201d tests. The Court has already found on a number of occasions, albeit in the context of Article 8, that a judicial review remedy incapable of examining the issue of proportionality does not meet the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7\u00a7 13539, ECHR 1999VI; Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, \u00a7\u00a7 105-07, ECHR 2003I; and Keegan v. the United Kingdom, no. 28867/03, \u00a7\u00a7 40-43, ECHR 2006X)."

The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background, but the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court (see Biao v. Denmark [GC], no. 38590/10, \u00a7 93, 24 May 2016). A wide margin is usually allowed to the State when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy (ibid.). The Court considers that when a claim is made concerning a lack of access to public buildings within the context of the right to respect for private and family life, a similarly wide margin of appreciation should be afforded to the State. However, since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must have regard to the changing conditions in Contracting States and respond, for example, to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved (see Enver \u015eahin , \u00a7 62, and Glor , \u00a7 75, both cited above)."

For the same practical reasons, the States may find it inexpedient to require these authorities to abide by a set of very strict procedural safeguards or to deliver very detailed decisions. Nevertheless, these considerations may not serve to undermine the effectiveness of the appeal procedure, and it must be ensured that a genuine effort is made to address the substance of arguable individual complaints concerning electoral irregularities and that the relevant decisions are sufficiently reasoned. In the present case, however, the conduct of the electoral commissions and courts and their respective decisions revealed an appearance of lack of any genuine concern for the protection of the applicant's right to stand for election."

Thus, it was not their own conduct that led to their ineligibility or disqualification. As noted above, they were prevented from standing for election because the number two candidate on the party's list had been withdrawn in connection with his untrue financial declaration. However, under the domestic law, electoral blocs or candidates on the list were not required to verify the truthfulness of financial representations that were not their own. It follows that the applicant party and the second applicant were sanctioned for circumstances which were unrelated to their own law-abiding conduct and were also outside their control. Notwithstanding the considerable latitude which States are allowed in establishing criteria for disqualification, the Court considers that the disqualification of the applicant party and the second applicant for the above reasons was disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, namely ensuring the truthful disclosure of the candidates' financial position and promoting the integrity of electoral blocs or unions."

Indeed, the State\u2019s solemn undertaking under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and the individual rights guaranteed by that provision would be illusory if, throughout the electoral process, specific instances indicative of failure to ensure democratic elections were not open to challenge by individuals before a competent domestic body capable of effectively dealing with the matter (see Namat Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 81)."

TURKEY; \u00a7 65: However, it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with. It has to satisfy itself that limitations do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence, and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 52). In particular, any such conditions must not thwart the free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature \u2013 in other words, they must reflect, or not run counter to, the concern to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of an electoral procedure aimed at identifying the will of the people through universal suffrage (see Hilbe v.\u00a0Liechtenstein (dec.), no. 31981/96, ECHR 1999VI, and Melnichenko v.\u00a0Ukraine, no.\u00a017707/02, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2004X). Any departure from the principle of universal suffrage risks undermining the democratic validity of the legislature thus elected and the laws which it promulgates. Exclusion of any groups or categories of the general population must accordingly be reconcilable with the underlying purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No.\u00a01 (see, mutatis mutandis, Aziz v. Cyprus, no. 69949/01, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2004V). Equally, once the wishes of the people have been freely and democratically expressed, no subsequent amendment to the organisation of the electoral system may call that choice into question, except in the presence of compelling grounds for the democratic order (see Lykourezos v.\u00a0Greece, no.\u00a033554/03, \u00a7 52, ECHR 2006...)."

ROMANIA; \u00a7 47: In that connection, the Court reiterates that the object and purpose of the Convention, which is an instrument for the protection of human beings, requires its provisions to be interpreted and applied in such a way as to make their stipulations not theoretical or illusory but practical and effective (see, for example, Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, \u00a7 33, Series A no.\u00a037; United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7\u00a033, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I; and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, \u00a7 100, ECHR 1999-III). The right to stand as a candidate in an election, which is guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and is inherent in the concept of a truly democratic regime, would be merely illusory if one could be arbitrarily deprived of it at any moment. Consequently, while it is true that States have a wide margin of appreciation when establishing eligibility conditions in the abstract, the principle that rights must be effective requires the finding that this or that candidate has failed to satisfy them to comply with a number of criteria framed to prevent arbitrary decisions. In particular, such a finding must be reached by a body which can provide a minimum of guarantees of its impartiality. Similarly, the discretion enjoyed by the body concerned\u00a0must not be exorbitantly wide; it must be circumscribed, with sufficient precision, by the provisions of domestic law. Lastly, the procedure for ruling a candidate ineligible must be such as to guarantee a fair and objective decision and prevent any abuse of power on the part of the relevant authority (see Podkolzina, cited above, \u00a7 35)."

For the purposes of applying Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, any electoral legislation must be assessed in the light of the political evolution of the country concerned, so that features that would be unacceptable in the context of one system may be justified in the context of another, at least so long as the chosen system provides for conditions which will ensure the \u201cfree expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u201d (see Yumak and Sadak v.  [GC], no. 10226/03, \u00a7 111, ECHR 2008). Furthermore, since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must have regard to the changing conditions within the respondent State and within Contracting States generally and respond, for example, to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved. In this regard, one of the relevant factors in determining the scope of the authorities\u2019 margin of appreciation may be the existence or non-existence of common ground between the laws of the Contracting States (see Glor v.

    "question": "How does the Court determine the effectiveness of an investigation under Article 3 in difficult security conditions, and what criteria does it consider in assessing compliance with the procedural obligation?",
    "answer": "Finally, the parameters for the assessment of compliance with the procedural requirement of Article 3, which converge with those under Article 2, is assessed on the basis of several essential parameters: the adequacy of the investigative measures, the promptness of the investigation, the involvement of the victim in the investigation and the independence of the investigation. These elements are inter-related and each of them, taken separately, does not amount to an end in itself. They are criteria which, taken jointly, enable the degree of effectiveness of the investigation to be assessed (R.R. and R.D. v. Slovakia, 2020, \u00a7 178, see also Mustafa Tun\u00e7 and Fecire Tun\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], 2015, \u00a7 225 with respect to Article 2). Independence For an investigation to be effective, the institutions and persons responsible for carrying it out must be independent from those targeted by it. This means not only a lack of any hierarchical or institutional connection but also practical independence (Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], 2015, \u00a7 118). Article 3 requires investigations to be prompt and to proceed with reasonable expedition. While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential to maintain public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and to prevent any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], 2015, \u00a7 121). The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of the investigation\u2019s effectiveness depend on the circumstances of the particular case. They must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (X and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2021, \u00a7 190). The procedural obligation under Article 3 continues to apply in difficult security conditions, including in a context of armed conflict. Even where the events leading to the duty to investigate occur in a context of generalized violence and investigators are confronted with obstacles and constraints which compel the use of less effective measures of investigation or cause an investigation to be delayed, the fact remains that Article 3 requires that all reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that an effective and independent investigation is conducted (Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], 2014, \u00a7 319).",

It has developed a number of guiding principles to be followed for an investigation to comply with the Convention\u2019s requirements. According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, for an investigation into alleged killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR 2007II, and \u00d6\u011fur v.

In addition, the investigation must be accessible to the victim\u2019s family to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests.

RUSSIA; \u00a7 121: The Court has stated on many occasions that the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force. It has developed a number of guiding principles to be followed for an investigation to comply with the Convention\u2019s requirements. According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, for an investigation into alleged killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, \u00a7 325, ECHR 2007II, and \u00d6\u011fur v. Turkey, [GC] no. 21954/93, ECHR 1999-III, \u00a7\u00a7 91-92). The investigation must also be effective in the sense of being capable of ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances, and to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Leonidis v.

In addition, the investigation must be accessible to the victim\u2019s family to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests. There must also be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation, the degree of which may vary from case to case (see Varnava, cited above, \u00a7 191, and Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, \u00a7\u00a0303, ECHR 2011 (extracts))."

The results of the investigation: The Court examines the outcome of the investigation and whether the authorities have taken appropriate measures to address the violations and prevent their recurrence in the future.\n\n5.

[GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7 70, ECHR\u00a01999IV).

Failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038 \u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

The criteria the Court has taken into consideration in determining this latter issue have included the severity of the offence in connection with which the search was effected, the manner and circumstances according to which the order was issued \u2013 in particular whether the warrant was based on a reasonable suspicion \u2013 and the content and scope of the warrant, having particular regard to the nature of the premises searched and the safeguards put in place to confine the impact of the measure within reasonable bounds (see Buck v.\u00a0Germany, no.\u00a041604/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a044-45, ECHR\u00a02005-IV; Smirnov v.

Failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands, without a satisfactory explanation, may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article\u00a038\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01\u00a0(a) of the Convention (see Timurta\u015f v.

In order to determine its proportionality, the Court must consider the impugned interference not only in the light of the content of the statements at issue, but also the context in which they were made. Furthermore, the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are also factors to be taken into account (see, for example, G\u00fcnd\u00fcz, \u00a7 42, and B\u00e9dat, \u00a7 79, both cited above)."

    "question": "What is the scope of the state's positive obligation to ensure careful regulation of the process in which the results of voting are ascertained, processed, and recorded under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1?",
    "answer": "Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 contains certain positive obligations of a procedural character, in particular requiring the existence of a domestic system for the effective examination of individual complaints and appeals in matters concerning electoral rights. Such a system ensures an effective exercise of individual rights to vote and to stand for election, maintains general confidence in the State\u2019s administration of the electoral process and constitutes an important device at the State\u2019s disposal in achieving the fulfilment of its positive obligation under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to hold democratic elections (Namat Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, 2010, \u00a7\u00a7 81 et seq.; Uspaskich v. Lithuania, 2016, \u00a7 93; Mugemangango v. Belgium [GC], 2020, \u00a7 69). Lastly, Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 covers the post-election period, including the counting of votes and the recording and transmission of the results. The State thus has a positive obligation to ensure careful regulation of the process in which the results of voting are ascertained, processed and recorded (Davydov and Others v. Russia, 2017, \u00a7\u00a7 284-285). The Court has held that post-election phases must be surrounded by precise procedural safeguards; the process must be transparent and open, and observers from all parties must be allowed to participate, including opposition representatives. States must ensure that arguable complaints by individuals concerning election irregularities are effectively addressed and that domestic decisions are sufficiently reasoned.",

However, the Court has already confirmed that the common principles of the European constitutional heritage, which form the basis of any genuinely democratic society, enshrine within themselves the right to vote in terms of the opportunity to cast a vote in universal, equal, free, secret and direct elections held at regular intervals (see the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters, paragraph 196 above). Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention explicitly provides for the right to free elections at regular intervals by secret ballot, and other principles have also been recognised in the Convention institutions\u2019 case-law (see Russian Conservative Party of Entrepreneurs and Others, cited above, \u00a7 70). In this setting, free elections are to be seen as both an individual right and a positive obligation of the State, comprising a number of guarantees starting from the right of the voters to form an opinion freely, and extending to careful regulation of the process in which the results of voting are ascertained, processed and recorded."

The investigation must also be thorough: the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. Furthermore, the investigation must be prompt and independent. The investigation lacks independence where members of the same unit as those implicated in the alleged ill-treatment undertook the investigation (Mikheyev v. Russia, no. 77617/01, \u00a7\u00a7 108-110, 26\u00a0January\u00a02006). Lastly, the investigation must afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny to secure accountability. While the degree of public scrutiny required may vary, the complainant must be afforded effective access to the investigatory procedure in all cases (Bat\u0131 and Others, cited above, \u00a7 137)."

The State has a positive obligation to ensure that the electoral process, including the ascertaining, processing, and recording of the results, is conducted in a fair, transparent, and adequate manner.\n\nThis positive obligation is not limited to the conduct of elections on polling day but extends to all stages of the electoral process. In the context of the post-electoral process, the State has a duty to ensure that the results of the elections are accurately and impartially ascertained, processed, and recorded. This includes the counting of votes, the tabulation of results, and the announcement of the winner.\n\nThe scope of the positive obligation depends on the circumstances of each case, and the Convention does not prescribe a uniform standard for how this obligation should be discharged. Factors such as the complexity of the electoral system, the level of public confidence in the electoral process, and the risks of electoral fraud or interference may influence the extent of the State's positive obligation.\n\nIn general, the State should take measures to prevent any form of electoral fraud, manipulation, or undue influence on the results. For instance, the State may be required to establish effective safeguards to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the vote count, such as random sampling and recounts, or to provide for independent oversight of the electoral process.\n\nMoreover, where there is evidence of electoral irregularities, the State has a positive obligation to investigate and remedy any breaches of the electoral rules. This may require the State to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into alleged electoral fraud or maladministration, with a view to restoring public confidence in the electoral process and ensuring that the will of the people is accurately reflected in the election results.\n\nIn conclusion, the positive obligation of the State under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 extends beyond the conduct of elections on polling day to include the process of ascertaining, processing, and recording the results. The State is required to take effective measures to ensure that the electoral process is impartial, transparent, and free from fraud or manipulation, and to take remedial action where there is evidence of breaches of the electoral rules.",

Such positive obligations may entail the taking of measures necessary to protect the right to property, particularly where there is a direct link between the measures an applicant may legitimately expect from the authorities and his effective enjoyment of his possessions, even in cases involving litigation between private entities. This means, in particular, that States are under an obligation to provide a judicial mechanism for settling effectively property disputes and to ensure compliance of those mechanisms with the procedural and material safeguards enshrined in the Convention. This principle applies with all the more force when it is the State itself which is in dispute with an individual (see Anheuser-Busch Inc., cited above, \u00a7 83, and Plechanow v.

First, where an applicant had suffered directly from State inaction, such as non-recognition of transsexuals, the case for a positive obligation was strong. Second, where positive action by the State was called for by an applicant to prevent interference by non-State bodies, such as in environmental and media cases, positive obligations were less readily invoked. Third, where an applicant alleged that positive action by individuals was called for, the extent of any positive obligation under Article 8 was at its weakest. The Government argued that relevant factors in determining the extent of the positive duty were the extent to which fundamental and essential aspects of private life were in issue; the prejudice suffered by the applicant; the breadth and clarity of the positive obligation sought to be imposed; and the extent of consensus among Council of Europe member States or internationally. With reference to these factors, they argued that they had no positive obligation to protect the applicant\u2019s privacy by providing for a legally binding pre-notification requirement."

An independent electoral authority should be established to supervise the electoral process and to ensure that it is conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with established laws which are compatible with the Covenant. States should take measures to guarantee the requirement of the secrecy of the vote during elections including absentee voting, where such a system exists. This implies that voters should be protected from any form of coercion or compulsion to disclose how they intend to vote or how they voted, and from any unlawful or arbitrary interference with the voting process. Waiver of these rights is incompatible with article 25 of the Covenant. The security of ballot boxes must be guaranteed and votes should be counted in the presence of the candidates or their agents. There should be independent scrutiny of the voting and counting process and access to judicial review or other equivalent process so that electors have confidence in the security of the ballot and the counting of the votes. Assistance provided to the disabled, blind or illiterate should be independent. Electors should be fully informed of these guarantees.\u201d COMPARATIVE-LAW MATERIAL"

LATVIA; \u00a7 67: The Court considers that in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No.\u00a01, when an interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions is perpetrated by a private individual, a positive obligation arises for the State to ensure in its domestic legal system that property rights are sufficiently protected by law and that adequate remedies are provided whereby the victim of an interference can seek to vindicate his rights, including, where appropriate, by claiming damages in respect of any loss sustained. Furthermore, where the interference is of a criminal nature, this obligation will in addition require that the authorities conduct an effective criminal investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution (see, mutatis mutandis, M.C. v. Bulgaria, no.\u00a039272/98, \u00a7\u00a7 151-153, ECHR 2003-XII). In that respect, it is clear that the obligation, like the obligation under Articles\u00a02 and 3 of the Convention to conduct an effective investigation into loss of life or allegations of ill-treatment, is one of means and not one of result; in other words, the obligation on the authorities to investigate and prosecute such acts cannot be absolute, as it is evident that many crimes remain unresolved or unpunished notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of the State authorities. Rather, the obligation incumbent on the State is to ensure that a proper and adequate criminal investigation is carried out and that the authorities involved act in a competent and efficient manner. Moreover, the Court is sensitive to the practical difficulties which the authorities may face in investigating crime and to the need to make operational choices and prioritise the investigation of the most serious crimes. Consequently, the obligation to investigate is less exacting with regard to less serious crimes, such as those involving property, than with regard to more serious ones, such as violent crimes, and in particular those which would fall within the scope of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. The Court thus considers that in cases involving less serious crimes the State will only fail to fulfil its positive obligation in that respect where flagrant and serious deficiencies in the criminal investigation or prosecution can be identified (cf. ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 167-168)."

Such a system ensures the effective exercise of individual rights to vote and to stand for election, maintains general confidence in the State\u2019s administration of the electoral process, and constitutes an important device at the State\u2019s disposal in achieving the fulfilment of its positive duty under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention to hold democratic elections. Indeed, the State\u2019s solemn undertaking under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and the individual rights guaranteed by that provision would be illusory if, throughout the electoral process, specific instances indicative of failure to ensure democratic elections were not open to challenge by individuals before a competent domestic body capable of effectively dealing with the matter (see Namat Aliyev, cited above, \u00a7 81)."
